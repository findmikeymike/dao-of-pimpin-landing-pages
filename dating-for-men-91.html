                <p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“We are gathered here today to solve a riddle as old as time. You can thank Adam— for when he first slid his crooked finger into the soft, warm slit of Eve, he set in motion the Eternal Conundrum of Man and a millennia of madness.. You have ensnared yourself in the Trap of all traps, and yet you have no idea of your own captivity. You came today with childish questions of pussy-piping and pick up lines, and it’s my lone hope that when you leave today, you will leave with something else entirely… And it will not be answer you came looking for. In fact, it will be a question.. The One Real Question… Neither I, nor Saint Peter himself has the answer for you. For it was you, and only you that created this mess, and it is you and only you who has the power to see your way out of it…” 
			A middle aged Pakistani man with a pitiful mustache raised his hand. Before being addressed, and with his hand still raised awkwardly, he rose and spoke in a thick Indian accent.
			“But sir, I did not pay to hear philosophical musings. I was told you could teach me how to fuck on college girls and find a good wife.”
			“Fuck on college girls you may Kapul, find a wife you may… but if and only if you come to Understand the Truth… women, dating, fucking… these are a symptom, a mere by-product of Pimping. They are not the Mission. They are the ice cold cups of Gatorade waiting for you at the pit-stops on the marathon of life… on the real Mission at hand… If it is only sex with beautiful women you desire Kapul, then find the Master of Commerce, take a seminar, make yourself a small fortune, and go to a whore house… but I challenge you to ask yourself after the first load you spew, if that was ‘It,’ if that pop was the truest desire of your heart. For the True Desire of man never falters or retreats. It is always there, calling…”
			“But what could possibly be better than some good snatch Master?!” interjected the Indian man. The other men agreed. 
			“You are a mouse in a closet looking for cheese. A mouse with no awareness to the vastness of the house you live in. A mouse that could never even fathom a journey to the other side of the neighborhood. A mouse that could never understand the fact that the neighborhood is but a mouse to the city, the city a mouse to the nation, and the nation a mouse to Earth. Are you such a fool that you spent 4,000 dollars and flew from India to learn of the cheese in the closet? Lower your arm. Sit down.”
			“Sir… I was born in Georgia,” muttered the Pakistani man.
			“I enjoy cheese. Greatly, sir. My uncle owns a pizza parlor in Brooklyn. So you will teach us nothing of women? Please teach us of women, Master,” interjected a man who wanted to Believe.
			“I will teach you about women and the simple form of pimping as you know it to be, as conquering The Woman is the central battle in all of your narratives, and the greatest hurdle to your evolution. Her and her sweet titties and her sharp tongue, they are the center of your Universe. She sends fear up your spine, and electricity through your little dick. She makes your voice shake, and your knees weak. She takes one look at another man, and crushes your fragile soul. She must be conquered…”
			The men perked up, ready to receive and savor every word of esoteric wisdom the Master had in store.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“So he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself ‘the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,’ so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: ‘The first five rounds are on you.’ Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn’t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn’t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn’t for another two weeks—suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?”
			“I am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!” Gregory shouted without hesitation.
			“Yes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.’ This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of ‘losing’ some girl he doesn’t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.”
			“Sir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women… but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?” replied a curious believer.
			“No, no, no… you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I’m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from… a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call… I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot… there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself ‘How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?’ You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.”  
			“So I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?” replied the man.
			“No—on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection… for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp’s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man’s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Okay? You craft sandwiches… and you say that as if it is an empty pursuit… a realm that holds no potential for any kind of evolution or magic... but let me tell you the potential Mission of man comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. It is not in the “what man does” but in the “how he does it.” Do not think that Mission means a man must start a multi-million dollar company, or win an Oscar, or reach some fantastical level of social status. You may have a man that’s truest calling in life is simply to Teach... maybe his passion is for history and he teaches a middle school class. What matters is the hunger, relentlessness, and creativity he approaches his teaching with. How far he is willing to push to be the most legendary teacher that ever walked the Earth? Let me ask you… why do you spend your life making sandwiches?” 
			“Because it pays a fair wage sir, and I get joy in seeing people eat. I love sauces and the way they can bring a sandwich to life. I put sauces on everything.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, so there is some passion there, some curiosity… Some juice to the endeavor beyond the pay… You want to feed your fellow man, and the focus and essence of what you do is in the Creation and giving of something of substance to the world. Then by god, make the best fucking sandwiches the world has ever tasted! Step in that shop every day with the mindset that there is the possibility of the Unknown happening… create a space for the magic and step into it! No preconceived notions, no mental scripts or limitations! You love sauces, oh?!”
			“I fucking love them sir. A good sauce is like a good woman. Hard to find and in limited supply,” replied the pudgy adept.
			“Then stay an hour late every day for an entire year, mixing the sauces and rubs in different combinations and proportions until you have stumbled on a sauce like no other! A sauce so zesty and delicious it sends a shiver down the spine! Toss and turn in your bed in the late hours of the night deliberating on the best name for your sauce and how you are going to deliver it to every tongue on Earth! Make the most beautiful sandwich you have ever made, lather it with your Magic Sauce and present it to your boss… and when he takes that first bite, and his eyes roll back into his head in ecstasy, you tell him, “My special sauce sir, The Magic Sauce! I have spent a year on this and I would love your blessing in adding it to the menu!” And how will he respond?”
			“He’ll love it! He’ll say it’s genius!” shouted the man excitedly.
			“No! He will not! For his Mechanical Mind will tell him that your sauce may steal his thunder, and encroach on his power over the shop! So what will you say to him?”
			“I will say but sir—’’
			“You will say nothing to him! To bloody hell with him! He will not stop the Sauce! And so you offer it to customers when he is not there… and soon enough when everyone in that sandwich shop is lining up for your goddamn sauce and the big man gets hip to the jig and fires your ass, you smile to yourself knowing that your first set-back, the first test of your Will, means you are on the right track. So you press on… you take your earnings and buy the ingredients in bulk, and start concocting it at home… until your entire refrigerator is stocked with ‘The Magic Sauce.’ You go door to door, giving samples to people and selling your sauce… And soon enough folks are emailing the local paper about the young guy selling his sauce door to door, and the paper writes an article… the local market asks you if they can sell your sauce… and now, like an alchemist, you have transformed a mundane job and life in the sandwich shop into something More, into a Mission! And with each hurdle and each mini victory, your heart will sing and your mind will start looking at all the impossibles as Possible. You will start to see your life and destiny through a new lens. This is what puts blood in a man’s veins and a shine in his eyes. Is this a pursuit you are Ready for my boy?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“You can tell that to the judge,” the Head Fed snipped back. He turned to the group of men. 
			“Now as for you gentlemen… you too, have broken many serious new laws that come with stiff penalties and serious jail time. These laws include: One— Payment for Information Endangering Women… Two— Actively pursuing and engaging with a known Pimp… Three— Pursuing Pimpdom… Now I will present you with two options. You may plead negligence based on the newness of this law, verbally rebuke Pimpdom and your activities here today, and agree to reveal the financial details and all payments made to Mr. Sammy Davis Jr., to be used against in the court of law… or you can face the Law yourself, and continue your pursuits with Mr. Davis behind cold, metal bars for decades to come. I will now ask that the compliers of my first request come stand over here on the left side of the room with our agents.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">In the back of the armored police van, the Master, Raul, and Gregory sat in complete silence. The Master had not lifted his head since his arrest. He had been broken... yet for Gregory and Raul, it made no difference who or what Sammy Davis Jr. truly was. They had heard Truth in his voice and his teachings, and the vessel through which those Truths were delivered made no difference to them. 
			Then, very quietly, with great beauty and tone, the Master began to sing weepingly: 
			“Oh I’ve seen fire and I’ve seen rain… I’ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end… I’ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend...” 
			He lifted his shoulder to his face and wiped away two tears. As he sniffled, he continued to sing quietly. Gregory and Raul glanced at each other, their faces blank and expressionless.</p>
