                <p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“And now here you are, trying your best to pacify this sea of emotions, and win this woman’s affections back, and like the simp that you are, you waste the next six hours in a state of high anxiety, trying to find something clever to say to rekindle the fire with this woman. You’re sure you’ve got it… oh yeah. You’ve got it this time… and you hit the send… and the hands of the clock start ticking so slowly, they’re damn near going in reverse. Twenty minutes… two hours… the fear builds… eight hours… three days… and nothing. Not a word. You played out the sequence of an entire relationship with a girl you didn’t know from a hole in the ground, and the whole thing was a mirage, a head trip… You were on The Ride… from fear to love, from love to fear... And so usually you take a cold shower and chalk it up as another loss, bite down on the pain… another heartbreak in that bag you carry, a little more dead weight laid up on your spirit. But this time, this time is different, because not only were you watching it happen, you were feeling it happen, and you were beginning to Understand the Motion… the Language. And so like the crafty and stubborn and determined man that you are, the next one comes along and you flip the script. Beat for beat, you flip the fucking script. Right at the peak of the warmth and excitement, right when she sends you so many goddamn emojis you start to think the girl may have schizophrenia, right at the zenith of the Love and heat… you disappear… Nowhere to be found… And The Ride is in motion…”
			“But Master, surely the man with the classic smile and warm scent does have the advantage… You cannot tell me that wasn’t part of her attraction?” said an ambivalent man in the back.
			“I am teaching you real Magic, known and Understood by one man in ten thousand, and you’re still asking about the fellow with the classic smile and tangerine scent? Do you see what I mean when I say men miss the forest for the trees? Yes the man with the sharp smile does have an advantage. He, like you, has a false sense of the what the woman truly desires. He has been told his entire life that his beautiful face was the thing that truly spoke to the heart of a Woman, and therefore, rather conveniently, tricked himself into a conviction and confidence that allowed him to be at ease around women.”
			The Master turned and looked directly at the ambivalent man.
			 “I am not telling you that a woman does not have eyes, or can’t see a man with a perfectly symmetrical face, chiseled chest, strong arms and feel no Want. Yes, she absolutely may feel some tingle in her loins, have a visceral reaction, but I am telling you that her hither brains are taking those as signals… signals for something that she senses may lie under the surface… a man at ease with himself, a man with the power to Move her. I’m telling you that if that beefcake does not Move her emotions, and I get seven minutes alone with her in the back of some dimly lit dive bar, she will be rubbing my belly and calling me daddy in the bed of the nearest roach motel before one of you can say “But his abs!” 
			The Master shook his gut with both hands and continued.
			“Do you understand? What I am telling you is that a woman will adjust the way she Sees you to match the way that you make her feel…Listen carefully. I said a woman will adjust the way she sees you to match the way that you make here FEEL. Understand that sex appeal does not happen in the gym, it happens in the heart… in the attitude, in the energy. Take the ugliest motherfucker in this room, and if his Pimpin is tight enough, I’m telling you within twenty minutes she can be looking at him like he was the genetic spawn of Leonardo DiCaprio and Beyonce. Where’s my little Indian friend? Yes, even you Kapul.”
			“My name is not Kapul, it is Gregory, Master,” said the Indian man meekly.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">The Master took a deep breath and the fire returned to his voice.
			“Do you see Her now? Do you Understand the Reality of the creature that once made you tremble in fear? How could this creature ever Hurt you? What could she ever Take from you? Sear this image in your mind, picture it day and night, let it be the first thing you see in the morning, the last thing you see at night.. let it paint the skies of every dream you dream... and in time, the software of your mind that deals with women will take on a new shape, a new perception… one that is more in line with Reality… one that can immerse itself in a new Language… and as the script of this software is rewritten, the other softwares of the Mind too become more malleable, more unsure of themselves, and easier to adjust or destroy. This process is a key aspect of the evolution from man to Pimp… Now repeat after me: She is not the enemy. She is just like me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“If we cut all my hair off, what will you have to run your hands through tomorrow morning?” Gregory replied with a sly charm. 
			Raul looked on with great joy and amusement. The tatted hottie’s cheeks flushed florescent pink, and though she was emotionally aroused and intrigued by such boldness and wit from the most unexpected of men, she could not keep up with his Dance, and defaulted to a front of offense. 
			“Wow… you really just said that?” she muttered dully. 
			“You heard daddy, and unless you want his named tattooed on the low of your back, I suggest you play nice with him. How about you use that womanly wile of yours and go snatch all three of us a drink. That should be no challenge for a girl like you. We’ll wait here,” Raul poked coyly. 
			“Oh, me go get the drinks? You two are quite the duo… the chivalry!” She shook her head, half-frazzled, half-bemused, and retreated to her friend. 
			Her friend was watching the encounter, appraising the men with her own growing curiosity. Who were they? Why were they so cool and unaffected? How many hearts must they have conquered to gain such wit and indifference? 
			Raul slung his arm around Gregory’s shoulder and they turned towards the bar—completely unfazed by the women’s exit. 
			“Two whiskeys, hard and straight, mam,” Gregory said to the bartender. 
			The bartender poured heavy glasses and slid them across the bar. Raul and Gregory grabbed their drinks and clinked them. 
			“To the Path. To the Master. To the Mission. To fucking the shit out of this strange, beautiful life...” exclaimed Raul.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">Raul the Pimp, 		Let the contents of this envelope serve you on 
	The Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>
