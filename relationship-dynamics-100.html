                <p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“You missed a spot,” he snarled. 
			Raul’s blood began to boil. He had a fleeting vision of cracking the man over the head with the handle of his mop and flushing his remains down the toilet. It was not the first time he had been treated with such disrespect and contempt by his boss, but it was the most brash, and as infuriated as he was in the moment, there was a part of him that felt it was deserved. You are thirty-eight years old Raul! And this is how you spend your precious life? Cleaning toilets and replacing light bulbs for barbarians! Slaving away for pennies! It’s been twenty years now, Raul! Get it together!
			There was a more hopeful time in Raul’s life when he did have a Dream. He had grand and lucid visions of his very own janitorial company, ‘Delgado’s Diligent Cleaning.’ The most esteemed and prestigious cleaning service in all of Little Rock. Raul could see in vivid, crystallized color a satellite view of his vans crawling on every corner of the city. He saw people at stop lights giving the thumbs up to his workers and the occasional woman flashing her bosoms in the front yard as he passed in the ‘Boss Van’. He saw warm, pink suds soaking into terminally ill carpet, and a time-lapse of their resuscitations to a youthful vigor. 
			But as the gears of the galaxy churned on, and the years passed, and the hell-raising women crept in the cracks of his sad life to tap the last of his blood, the color and clarity of Raul’s visions faded away, leaving behind only the carcass of a Dream.. a pile of bones and a few shreds of dried meat. He needed a win in life, something… anything... to give him a bit of faith and keep him Going. 
			Raul pulled out of the Lake Crest parking lot and  floored it. His ’87 Volvo shrieked and wailed as it barreled down the open road, rattling maniacally as it surged to its top speed. The odometer read thirty-eight miles per hour. With the motel and all of its horror finally out of sight, Raul dug into his pocket, pulled out the mystical notecard, and placed it in his lap. He gently stroked the card with his thumb, over and over, as if to ensure its secrets would not escape. The cars behind him on the single lane road beeped in agony, just as they always did. “Forget them, Raul! Stay focused… You may just be holding the ticket to a new life, Raul!” he thought to himself. In four short days, he would have his answer.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">"Now we have begun to explore a very important question. How does one start? Where can he begin in the real world? And I will tell you, with everything said here today, if you approach a woman with this knowledge, in the moment, nothing will change. Your hands will still shake, your armpits will run.. Because the Mechanical Mind is your master, and it hasn’t changed a bit. You cannot reason with the Mechanical Mind, you cannot arm it with a few nifty knowings and expect it to change a thirty year course. The Mechanical Mind cannot be moved as the Fear will still be there guarding the kingdom. The mind, the fear, they cannot be shaken or coaxed from their position. They must be nuked, obliterated! And so to annihilate the fear, first we must look directly at the fear, and understand the fear. Where it came from. How it came to be…”
			The Master scanned the room to make sure the men were still with him. They were.
			“The Fear was birthed from the womb of The Lie— back when you were but a shrimp. Your mother started to tell you, ‘If you want girls to like you, you need to brush your hair.’ You watched the television show of the bumbling man and saw him burn his first date to the ground, cursing himself the whole way home. You watched your older brother retreat to his bedroom and hibernate in agony after his first girlfriend gave him the shaft. You were bombarded with advertisements selling you products that would make you more enticing to her eye. All these things convincing you that your life’s purpose was to appeal to and appease the woman, to bow beneath her throne like a measly pauper and beg for a whiff of her pure and perfect feet. And as each day passed, your young, impressionable mind began to spin a web. Every mishap with a woman, every wrong word, every heartbreak, another fly caught in the web, never to die, only to squirm and gnaw at you as you carried on your journey. And every time you went to open your mouth in the presence of a woman, the little flies screamed and shrieked in unison ‘Not another fly! There is no room in this web! Please, spin a new web! Choose another battle!’ The Fear kicked in, and any chance at presence, clarity, Magic—eliminated. This is the root and flowering of the Fear. This is the web that must be cut from the mind.”
			Raul closed his eyes and scanned the webs woven across his mind. He saw each of his ex-wives, with eight limbs, skittering frantically from one side of his skull to the other, whispering covertly to each other as their paths crossed. He heard their taunts and laughter rippling through the canyons of his Being. He had a vision from the past, and remembered the look on his father’s face the muggy summer night his mother left with another man. He was eleven years old, and for sixth months straight, Raul slept next to his father, in fear the man may reach for the pistol under his bed and off himself in the night. 
			“So let us start the process of cutting… and we start with a Truth, the flies are phantom. They are an imagining, an echo of a non-real past. And the women and experiences that gave way to the flies, they were not what you thought, your perceptions of the Real distorted by The Lie. You looked upon her as if she was ‘It,’ the center of the Universe, the Mission, the Light and the Way. But what is she truly? A lost creature on a strange planet, on a journey in search of something More... just like you, just as fearful as you, just as insecure as you. Yes even the most beautiful woman... what does she see in the mirror?”
			The congregation hadn’t a clue what went through the mind of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Now let us face the beast: Fear… There is natural fear, the healthy fear that was programmed into the hardware of your mind at birth to keep you alive... this  fear is not the problem. The problem lies in the conditioned fear and aversions, the ones you have gathered along the journey that are irrational, and serve you in no way. The majority of these fears are of a social nature, and have to do with your acceptance in the tribe. There was a time when these fears served a purpose for man, as being cast out of the tribe meant certain death in the wild, but both man and the world alike have evolved. A man can survive and thrive on his own without the approval of the family, friends, and society around him. In many ways, his willingness to leave ‘The Group' is the beginning of his journey to his highest self, the true Pimp in him. Look at the life of any Christ or Buddha or great rockstar and you will see… they did not walk in line with society, they vowed for no man or woman’s approval… the Magic of their lives and stories was in opposition to these things.”
 			“Master, tell us more of dealing with these fears and entanglements,” exclaimed Gregory. 
			“First, we understand the difference between fear and aversion. Both must be conquered on the path to Pimpdom. The fear is what makes your heart race and hands shake. Aversions are the things that make you less comfortable in life and bring an unpleasantness to your mind. To unwrite these softwares of fear and aversion you have installed in the Mind, we first be conscious of them. For each of you has had different experiences and spun different webs… different Imprints… and accordingly, there will be different paths to their undoing. Let’s start with you, snacker with the lisp, tell me something that makes your skin crawl, something that strikes no fear in you, but you avoid like the plague.”
			“I hate being wet in clothing, sir. Especially jeans… I do not leave the house when it’s raining past a drizzle.” 
			“Well good gracious, imagine that… a grown man refusing to be involved with life and the world because he does not want to get a little wet. How much Magic and opportunity he may have missed lingering just beyond the rain… It was the Log Flume I presume?” 
			“Good god, Master? How—how could you have known? Yes, it was indeed the Log Flume. I remember being ten years old at the waterpark and the woman guaranteeing me if I sat in the back I would not take on any water… at worst a light mist. I was soaked to the bone and my breasts and rolls protruded from my t-shirt and the other children called me the Flume Whale for nearly a year!” 
			“And as the pain and embarrassment of such an archetypal scene was branded with a hot iron into the Mind, the Web began to spin… the fear left a trail… a present day aversion… and a very silly thing that holds you back in life. It will only continue to hinder you so we must destroy it at once! I want you to put on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt every single day for the next month and have your neighbor dowse you with a hose before you leave your house. I mean drenched and dripping to the damn bone. When you are soaked to the bone, I want you to verbally say aloud, ‘Out with all remnants and noise of the past, for they are but a dream. I am baptized in these waters and made clean again.’ Then go about your business as usual... The first few days you will think of nothing but your discomfort, but with each passing day, you will become used to it. Your mind will accept that you are wet and surrender its useless fight... and day by day the imprint in your mind will begin to evaporate, hell you may even begin to enjoy the cool sensation it brings and how alert you have become. You may start enjoying it so goddamn much you have to pay your neighbor a monthly salary to hose you down in your clothes everyday...” 
			“Master I have no relation with my neighbors.” 
			“Then it will be one hell of an ice breaker... ‘Hello my good man, would you mind spraying me with your fucking hose?’ What sane man could refuse such good fun?”
			“But Master if—”
			The pudgy man tried to interject but was steamrolled by the impassioned Master.
			“After you have completed this torrential month, I want you to repeat the process, but this time, I want you out in the world shirtless. Let those titties swing and that belly shake. For we must get to the root of this web, right down to the fear that birthed it.”
			The pudgy man with the lisp opened his mouth to respond but the Master pressed on.
			“Now let us move on to someone else. You there... little ginger man with the large nose, hiding his head… yes, you… what is that haunts your dreams?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“I too stand by the Master.. I too am guilty of pursuing the Path of the Pimp—and I shall pursue it every day until death!” Gregory roared. 
			There was a heart and fullness in his voice, a depth and conviction he, nor anyone else on Earth had ever heard materialize from within him before. 
			The bitch men looked on in astonishment. As they stood on the left side of the room as “free men,” there was a part of all of them that Understood they were witnessing something special Unfolding— something that they couldn’t quite put their finger on, something their Mechanical Minds just couldn’t fully compute. 
			The agents closed in on Raul and Gregory, threw them to the ground violently, and cuffed them.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory entered the Tavern with an energy and ease they had never stepped into anywhere before…. like two young warriors who had just put their lives on the line for the first time and claimed victory in a fierce battle. Only an hour ago they’d been staring down a life behind bars... what was there to fear? Who or what could possibly Move them after a day like today? 
			As they approached the bar, a young hottie with tattoos grabbed Gregory’s arm. 
			“Hey daddy… how about a beer for the pretty lady? Hm? Buy me a beer?” yapped the hottie with an air of entitlement and expectation. 
			“Would you like my ATM number too?” Gregory replied in a calm, careless tone. 
			The girl was a bit taken aback. It was not what she expected to hear come out of this small Indian man’s mouth. 
			“Well, if you give me your ATM number, I could take you to get a haircut and maybe even get that dirty little mustache shaved off,” she challenged.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">When Raul got home, he sank into the couch and pulled the brown envelope from his pocket. He unfolded the envelope and placed it on the table in front of him. 
			As he replayed the Magic and adventure of the day, he became curious about so many things. How did the Master know my name? I never even spoke it… and I used a fake name when I signed up? Where was Master from? How many able Pimps were out there?…  He even wondered what the fake legal documents detailing his ‘crimes of Pimping’ might look like, and how clever the Master’s final Test was. He thought about framing the document and posting it in his bedroom as a constant reminder of The Path. 
			Raul tore the envelope and reached inside. He pulled out a folded sheet of paper and read aloud to himself:</p>
