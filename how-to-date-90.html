                <p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Let us start at the beginning: You simps open your mouth to speak to a woman, and she is not moved. Hell, she’s usually appalled. She looks into your eyes and the fiery goddess deep within her subconscious immediately recognizes: this man does not Understand. This man does not know The Way. He is weak and confused, fearful and timid, he has no true life-force, no Presence or Awareness of this Great Unfolding and his journey will be no Ride… You hit her with your crafty lines and your bad boy smirk you practiced in the mirror for twelve hours, and little do you know, you have made the original mistake. You spoke to her in a language she does not speak. Your words have fallen on deaf ears.” 
			The Master raised his voice.
			“The true language of a woman makes not a sound. The true language and currency with a woman—and all humans for that matter—is Emotion. It is Feeling… And while there are many shades of emotion, many hues, there are only two true and primal emotions: Love and Fear. It is love and fear that cause the indescribable thump in her chest, the sweat in her palms. The little league player knows how to make her feel loved, the division one player knows how to deal her a bit of fear and anxiety, but the Pimp knows that it is neither love nor fear that truly fills the deepest yearnings of a woman’s soul.”
			The Master leaned forward and paused for a beat. He spoke slowly, with great intention. 
			“It is The Ride… the ride from love to fear, from fear to love, that ignite her bones and dampen her labias. It is in the Movement between these internal worlds that the power lies. It is The Ride that awakens her being, and reminds her that she is Here, Now… that something is Happening—and that she’s a part of it. It is The Ride, the exhilarating emotional journey, that she truly yearns, that she seeks.”
			The Master eased back into his default posture.
			“So when we talk about engaging with a woman, connecting with a woman, attracting a woman, banging the shit out of a woman, this is the language we are speaking, the language of Feeling. It is the cinder and soot the castle is built upon.”
			A skeptical man with slicked back hair, a gaudy satin shirt, and dark eyes snickered. He made sure his mockery of the Master was loud enough for all to hear.
			“Ha! Our words do not matter? A man can say ‘anything?’ A solid pick-up line cannot capture a woman?! Gimme a break!” scoffed the skeptical man with dark eyes.
			“My brooding Casanova, have these pre-rehearsed lines ever worked for you?” the Master snapped back.
			“My ‘name’ is Judas Finkleberry, and yes, in fact they do work. I have spent time with a ‘True’ Master, one who has given me a sequence of Words that can have even the most strident feminist butt-fucking-naked and begging for it in twenty minutes flat,” sneered the cynical Judas. 
			There were audible gasps from the men. The Master was tickled.
			“Oh is that so, Mr. Finklebobby? And I gather that is why you are here with us today? Because your incantations and spells are so potent with the woman?” replied the Master calmly.
			“Four words is all it takes…” said Judas with a scowl.
			“Get in my Ferrari!” jested the Master.
			The congregation of men snickered. Raul looked to Judas and sensed a heavy, metallic vibe about the man, as if he had been hurt by the world, and vowed to return the hurt by any means necessary. The Master turned his attention back to the believers. 
			“Let us proceed. And if The Dao proves false, we’ll all pitch in and pay our dear Judas for the real Magic. Deal?”
			The collective of men nodded in agreement.
			“What I am saying is that your words are only as useful as the Feelings they carry, a shell to transmit the real Language and Magic. The weight they hold is but a fart in the wind in comparison to the energy and emotion you create simply from your Presence. I am telling you that you can say damn near anything to a woman, yes damn near anything, and if You and your essence are in the right space, holding a certain Presence and ease, it will Move a woman far more than Mr. Finklebottom and his four sacred words. I’m saying that the energy and sound of your voice alone carry far more weight than the words that fall from the tongue.”
			The misanthropic Judas shook his head and looked at the Master with venom in his beady eyes. The Master paid no mind to his hostility and continued.
			“You are always asking what to say to a woman, and I’m telling you it is the wrong question. The reason you and ninety seven percent of men struggle so much with women is because you are eternally missing the forest for the trees. You are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. You have been walking around for damn near your entire life like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to figure out the mysteries of the woman, and every where you turn, someone else equally as confused is there to point you in the wrong direction.”
			“But Master how does one learn to speak this sacred language?” said a zealous man. 
			“How does one learn how to do anything? He studies very closely the one who does. You have seen men all your life who had that magic touch with women, but you were watching for all the wrong things. You assumed it must have been his classic smile or the tangerine scent of his cologne… I’m telling you to not just watch the man, but Feel him.. feel his jive, his ease, the rhythm he speaks at, the color he uses to describe the world around him.. I’m telling you to watch yourself, and your own emotions.”
			The Master stood up and began to pace the stage smoothly and slowly.
			“Imagine for a moment, you are speaking with a woman that by some strange glitch in the matrix does take interest in you, and you are going back and forth in swift digital conversation, and you are sure you’ve it in the bag, already picked out the fresh denim you are going to wear when you meet her, and the first surface in the house where you plan to make love to her, and then all sudden THWAP… crickets… She’s gone. Missing in action. Nowhere on the face of the mother fucking Earth to be found… What is it you feel? You feel the Fear. You fear you must have said something wrong, you fear your last line was not clever enough. You fear she met someone that was More than you… You were in the space of love, and excitement, and anticipation… and now in the blink of your god damn eye, all of that is gone, and all that’s left is fear. She has taken you for The Ride, and like a flaming bag of shit on the doorstep of your poor soul… you can’t look away. You can’t stop thinking about it. It gnaws at you and ignites something in you. You feel anger at yourself for another botch. And then out of no where, the bitch is back! She has risen like Christ! And she tells you she was just ‘caught up with some things and that her aunt had surgery’ and asks you ‘How are you’, and what do you feel? You feel the love again! You feel relieved it was not some idiotic thing you said. You feel excited you might still get to do some fuckin.. maybe even fall in love.. But then… as you obsessively re-read your conversation to get reacquainted with the dynamic and where you left off, you notice those three god forsaken little words: “How. Are. You.” and you start to get a funny feeling in your stomach. How am I? How - am - I? What happened to the heat and the romance? I address the goddamn Postman with more passion than that… The woman went from paragraphs of nonsense and emojicons, to those three lifeless little words… And now all the sudden, it’s the blink of an eye later, and she’s given you the the Pimp Special.. she’s taken you on the Round Trip… You felt the warm tingles of bliss running up your spine and in a single instant, kapoof—the tingles were gone, and you were riding the lightening 2,000 miles per hour straight back to the land of Fear…”
			The Master’s pace picked up speed as he continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">The men howled and whistled in excitement. The Master shot up off the ground and back into perfect lotus posture, stared straight at Kapul and with a veiled joy in his voice replied, 
			“Don’t you dare move a muscle, Kapul... For if we were to let you loose on these streets… a savage like you… the rest of us would have to fight just for a chance to bend over that dead bird in the bush.” 
			The Master began to chuckle, and the men joined him. It was a nice moment, the Master and all the men sharing a laugh, a moment of true warmth and communion, a mome— 
			“SILENCE!” roared Master. 
			His empty glass flew across the room and shattered against something hard. He stared out at the men with a piercing and violent mania in his eyes. The men’s laughter seized so quickly it sounded as if someone had clicked a mute button on the room. They snapped back into upright position. Their pounding hearts and wavering breathes scored the silence like a symphony. The mania and madness in the Master’s eyes quickly faded back to a brilliant shimmer as he snickered, 
			“See what I did there? I took you for the Round Trip… The ol Pimp Special… Did you catch that Kapul?” 
			“Yes Master, believe it or not.. in the bliss of the moment, I had a strange feeling you were going to vault the energy and emotion of the room into a new direction. Your words have not fallen on deaf ears,” Gregory replied with a quiet pride. 
			“Well I’ll be damned… maybe Kapul is He after all!”
			Gregory turned his head to the men around him with a mischievous grin. He was not the man to count out.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, I once heard a man I presumed wise say that ‘she is never your girl, it’s just your turn.’ That a female is always looking for the better deal? Is this so? Is there hope for a man who does not need a harem and would like to find a woman to spend his life with?” 
			“Due to the impermanence of most relationships—not just those with the woman, you could say there’s some Truth to that... but the idea that all women are just slaves to their genetic imperatives—constantly on the hunt for a higher-status man ignores that there is more to a woman… and more to humanity, than just evolution and chemistry. The Deep Web Overlords who preach this fail to see the bigger picture: that the soul of a being has been on a long journey, each at different levels of refinement and Awareness. Ask the same man who said, ‘all woman are the same and will surely betray you’ about Mother Theresa and he will tell you she did not go around the world to feed the needy, she went around the world to try a cock from every nation! The truth of the matter is that the majority of humans in the present era, women and men alike, do not stick to any strict moral or ethical code and have been conditioned to look out for Themselves and do whatever feels good. So yes, you will meet many base women, many scoundrels, many undercover hookers, just as the decent women out there will meet many pathetic, limp men. Both sexes are a victim to the lies of the Shadow, and there distrust of each other so deep, entire movements and groups have formed... the Feminists, the Red Pillers... each using the other as a scapegoat for their own confusion. With such chaos in the modern age, is it possible to find a good woman to spend your life with? To that I say, I do believe it is possible for two souls on a similar frequency, with a certain sense of maturity and clarity, to live consciously and enjoy a life together. If it is your Will and Desire to meet a good-hearted, honest woman to spend the rest of your days with, then let it be so… romance it up, Dance with no fear. But know this—even if a man has the desire to spend his life with someone, he should be equipped to carry on the Mission and the Journey if the deeper power within him or the Almighty Pimp has other plans. For life is fleeting, love is fleeting, the world is fleeting, always, into the Great Abyss…”
			“Master, that was somehow… painfully hopeful and beautifully excruciating,” Gregory chirped.
			“Isn’t that the nature of life, Gregory? What Magic would there be—what Ride—if not for the Love and the Fear, the pain and the beauty, the symmetry and the chaos… That’s why we emphasize fluidity… and being like the River… Man must Understand everything just Is… You come with nothing, you leave with nothing. That.. is True Freedom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“And what matters is your Will, your Truth, and what you believe to be Right.. the world will try it’s best to push back, make you cave… but Man must conquer the Fear… he must never back down... at the end of the day there is only one real Question… will man choose Action or death. Are you a Pimp or a bitch, Raul?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Truthfully Lou… I have had a very long day but maybe another time,” Raul replied. 
			“Well, I had a great time with you and would love to see you again.. when are you free?” 
			“Aw hmm… You know I have a lot going on the next two weeks, but let’s keep in touch.”
