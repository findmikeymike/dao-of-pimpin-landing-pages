                <p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">"Now we have begun to explore a very important question. How does one start? Where can he begin in the real world? And I will tell you, with everything said here today, if you approach a woman with this knowledge, in the moment, nothing will change. Your hands will still shake, your armpits will run.. Because the Mechanical Mind is your master, and it hasn’t changed a bit. You cannot reason with the Mechanical Mind, you cannot arm it with a few nifty knowings and expect it to change a thirty year course. The Mechanical Mind cannot be moved as the Fear will still be there guarding the kingdom. The mind, the fear, they cannot be shaken or coaxed from their position. They must be nuked, obliterated! And so to annihilate the fear, first we must look directly at the fear, and understand the fear. Where it came from. How it came to be…”
			The Master scanned the room to make sure the men were still with him. They were.
			“The Fear was birthed from the womb of The Lie— back when you were but a shrimp. Your mother started to tell you, ‘If you want girls to like you, you need to brush your hair.’ You watched the television show of the bumbling man and saw him burn his first date to the ground, cursing himself the whole way home. You watched your older brother retreat to his bedroom and hibernate in agony after his first girlfriend gave him the shaft. You were bombarded with advertisements selling you products that would make you more enticing to her eye. All these things convincing you that your life’s purpose was to appeal to and appease the woman, to bow beneath her throne like a measly pauper and beg for a whiff of her pure and perfect feet. And as each day passed, your young, impressionable mind began to spin a web. Every mishap with a woman, every wrong word, every heartbreak, another fly caught in the web, never to die, only to squirm and gnaw at you as you carried on your journey. And every time you went to open your mouth in the presence of a woman, the little flies screamed and shrieked in unison ‘Not another fly! There is no room in this web! Please, spin a new web! Choose another battle!’ The Fear kicked in, and any chance at presence, clarity, Magic—eliminated. This is the root and flowering of the Fear. This is the web that must be cut from the mind.”
			Raul closed his eyes and scanned the webs woven across his mind. He saw each of his ex-wives, with eight limbs, skittering frantically from one side of his skull to the other, whispering covertly to each other as their paths crossed. He heard their taunts and laughter rippling through the canyons of his Being. He had a vision from the past, and remembered the look on his father’s face the muggy summer night his mother left with another man. He was eleven years old, and for sixth months straight, Raul slept next to his father, in fear the man may reach for the pistol under his bed and off himself in the night. 
			“So let us start the process of cutting… and we start with a Truth, the flies are phantom. They are an imagining, an echo of a non-real past. And the women and experiences that gave way to the flies, they were not what you thought, your perceptions of the Real distorted by The Lie. You looked upon her as if she was ‘It,’ the center of the Universe, the Mission, the Light and the Way. But what is she truly? A lost creature on a strange planet, on a journey in search of something More... just like you, just as fearful as you, just as insecure as you. Yes even the most beautiful woman... what does she see in the mirror?”
			The congregation hadn’t a clue what went through the mind of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“We love you master! We shall meet you in Pussy Heaven!” 
			The Master’s disciples scurried eagerly out of the auditorium. There was a new world awaiting them. A world of pussy, and Magic, and foul smelling toilets… As Raul walked towards the exit, he savored the Master’s last words, and as he savored each of them, he was struck dead in his track. “A dame has called on me. I must go. A dame has called on me. I must go.” Master? Leave his Mission for the beckoning call of a woman? Leave men in the birthplace of true Understanding for a quick and trivial nut? Oh Raul! You were almost fooled! A test so obvious! Look at the energy and impatience of these men that walk beside you! They are in fantasy land! 
			Raul turned and started back towards the stage. There were a handful of perceptive men who had not left their chairs. Raul reclaimed his seat next to Gregory, one of the few Unmovable devotees. Gregory leaned in to him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Sheesh, we’re going a little over my pay grade here,” joked one of the men.
			“I think some part of you already gets it,” said the Master, with a knowing smile.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">After fifty minutes, the van finally came to a halt and the doors swung open. By the bustling and busyness of the street outside it was clear they were in the downtown of a city, but anyone’s guess as to where exactly. 
			The federal agents grabbed the three men and yanked them out of the van. As they were steered into an old, brick building and prodded up a flight of stairs, the agents railed at them.
			“Move! Hurry it up, you fucking degenerates! We don’t have all day.”
			At the top of the stairs, the agents shoed them into a small, square room with plain white walls. Cameras in each corner stared down at them, poised to broadcast their images on the local late-night news as the most wicked and dangerous of men.
			The Head Fed followed the Master, Raul, and Gregory inside and shut the door behind them. In the middle of the room stood a black table and three brown envelopes, each tagged with their names. 
			“Gentlemen, inside each of these envelopes we have the official documentation and proof of each of your crimes. Now Mr. Davis won’t be going anywhere... but because I am an extremely forgiving man, I am going to give you two scoundrels one last opportunity to rebuke your crimes and agree to testify against Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.... and if you are willing to comply, you may go on your way,” the Head Fed said addressing Raul and Gregory. 
			“You heard the man. Do not be fools… my fate is already sealed, the show is over… go on your way,” said the Master.</p>
