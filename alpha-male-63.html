                <p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">"Now we have begun to explore a very important question. How does one start? Where can he begin in the real world? And I will tell you, with everything said here today, if you approach a woman with this knowledge, in the moment, nothing will change. Your hands will still shake, your armpits will run.. Because the Mechanical Mind is your master, and it hasn’t changed a bit. You cannot reason with the Mechanical Mind, you cannot arm it with a few nifty knowings and expect it to change a thirty year course. The Mechanical Mind cannot be moved as the Fear will still be there guarding the kingdom. The mind, the fear, they cannot be shaken or coaxed from their position. They must be nuked, obliterated! And so to annihilate the fear, first we must look directly at the fear, and understand the fear. Where it came from. How it came to be…”
			The Master scanned the room to make sure the men were still with him. They were.
			“The Fear was birthed from the womb of The Lie— back when you were but a shrimp. Your mother started to tell you, ‘If you want girls to like you, you need to brush your hair.’ You watched the television show of the bumbling man and saw him burn his first date to the ground, cursing himself the whole way home. You watched your older brother retreat to his bedroom and hibernate in agony after his first girlfriend gave him the shaft. You were bombarded with advertisements selling you products that would make you more enticing to her eye. All these things convincing you that your life’s purpose was to appeal to and appease the woman, to bow beneath her throne like a measly pauper and beg for a whiff of her pure and perfect feet. And as each day passed, your young, impressionable mind began to spin a web. Every mishap with a woman, every wrong word, every heartbreak, another fly caught in the web, never to die, only to squirm and gnaw at you as you carried on your journey. And every time you went to open your mouth in the presence of a woman, the little flies screamed and shrieked in unison ‘Not another fly! There is no room in this web! Please, spin a new web! Choose another battle!’ The Fear kicked in, and any chance at presence, clarity, Magic—eliminated. This is the root and flowering of the Fear. This is the web that must be cut from the mind.”
			Raul closed his eyes and scanned the webs woven across his mind. He saw each of his ex-wives, with eight limbs, skittering frantically from one side of his skull to the other, whispering covertly to each other as their paths crossed. He heard their taunts and laughter rippling through the canyons of his Being. He had a vision from the past, and remembered the look on his father’s face the muggy summer night his mother left with another man. He was eleven years old, and for sixth months straight, Raul slept next to his father, in fear the man may reach for the pistol under his bed and off himself in the night. 
			“So let us start the process of cutting… and we start with a Truth, the flies are phantom. They are an imagining, an echo of a non-real past. And the women and experiences that gave way to the flies, they were not what you thought, your perceptions of the Real distorted by The Lie. You looked upon her as if she was ‘It,’ the center of the Universe, the Mission, the Light and the Way. But what is she truly? A lost creature on a strange planet, on a journey in search of something More... just like you, just as fearful as you, just as insecure as you. Yes even the most beautiful woman... what does she see in the mirror?”
			The congregation hadn’t a clue what went through the mind of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">The Master took a deep breath and the fire returned to his voice.
			“Do you see Her now? Do you Understand the Reality of the creature that once made you tremble in fear? How could this creature ever Hurt you? What could she ever Take from you? Sear this image in your mind, picture it day and night, let it be the first thing you see in the morning, the last thing you see at night.. let it paint the skies of every dream you dream... and in time, the software of your mind that deals with women will take on a new shape, a new perception… one that is more in line with Reality… one that can immerse itself in a new Language… and as the script of this software is rewritten, the other softwares of the Mind too become more malleable, more unsure of themselves, and easier to adjust or destroy. This process is a key aspect of the evolution from man to Pimp… Now repeat after me: She is not the enemy. She is just like me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, so there is some passion there, some curiosity… Some juice to the endeavor beyond the pay… You want to feed your fellow man, and the focus and essence of what you do is in the Creation and giving of something of substance to the world. Then by god, make the best fucking sandwiches the world has ever tasted! Step in that shop every day with the mindset that there is the possibility of the Unknown happening… create a space for the magic and step into it! No preconceived notions, no mental scripts or limitations! You love sauces, oh?!”
			“I fucking love them sir. A good sauce is like a good woman. Hard to find and in limited supply,” replied the pudgy adept.
			“Then stay an hour late every day for an entire year, mixing the sauces and rubs in different combinations and proportions until you have stumbled on a sauce like no other! A sauce so zesty and delicious it sends a shiver down the spine! Toss and turn in your bed in the late hours of the night deliberating on the best name for your sauce and how you are going to deliver it to every tongue on Earth! Make the most beautiful sandwich you have ever made, lather it with your Magic Sauce and present it to your boss… and when he takes that first bite, and his eyes roll back into his head in ecstasy, you tell him, “My special sauce sir, The Magic Sauce! I have spent a year on this and I would love your blessing in adding it to the menu!” And how will he respond?”
			“He’ll love it! He’ll say it’s genius!” shouted the man excitedly.
			“No! He will not! For his Mechanical Mind will tell him that your sauce may steal his thunder, and encroach on his power over the shop! So what will you say to him?”
			“I will say but sir—’’
			“You will say nothing to him! To bloody hell with him! He will not stop the Sauce! And so you offer it to customers when he is not there… and soon enough when everyone in that sandwich shop is lining up for your goddamn sauce and the big man gets hip to the jig and fires your ass, you smile to yourself knowing that your first set-back, the first test of your Will, means you are on the right track. So you press on… you take your earnings and buy the ingredients in bulk, and start concocting it at home… until your entire refrigerator is stocked with ‘The Magic Sauce.’ You go door to door, giving samples to people and selling your sauce… And soon enough folks are emailing the local paper about the young guy selling his sauce door to door, and the paper writes an article… the local market asks you if they can sell your sauce… and now, like an alchemist, you have transformed a mundane job and life in the sandwich shop into something More, into a Mission! And with each hurdle and each mini victory, your heart will sing and your mind will start looking at all the impossibles as Possible. You will start to see your life and destiny through a new lens. This is what puts blood in a man’s veins and a shine in his eyes. Is this a pursuit you are Ready for my boy?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">The Master stood and began to walk elegantly from one side of the stage to the other as he spoke.
			“Right now in this very moment there are millions of men all over the world shouting ‘that fucking savage bitch! How could she?!’ Oh the chumps, if they had any Understanding of Reality, they would be thanking the woman for leaving, as there are two main ways a woman exits a man’s life against his wishings, and both are a gift to the man. The first way is if the woman was no good, and did something unforgivable… She blew his cousin or lied about her entire past… in which case he thanks her for taking out the trash and freeing him from her depravity. The second way, the more tragic of the two, is when she leaves because the man is weak or has moved into his feminine and her attraction disintegrates to nothingness… and begrudgingly, he must thank her for shining a light on this weakness and the chinks in his armor. For the pain inflicted by her exit serves as a baptism by fire and inspires a growth in him. This is how the Aware man deals with these scenarios. Unfortunately, for the majority of men, still anchored in their Mechanical Minds, they blame her and the world and fall further into the abyss of impotence and lifelessness. It is for this reason that the average disgruntled man sees the woman as the enemy, as his adversary. He has no awareness that her role in his narrative is to aid the blossoming of the true Power in him, by any means necessary. He makes getting the woman and keeping her his mission, he becomes reactive and emotional, he moves fully into his Feminine, and this repels her.” 
			The Master stopped his pacing and turned to the men. He stared straight out at them and spoke earnestly.
			“The truth is that a woman does not want to be man’s Mission, she does not want to be the center of his universe, or the reason he gets out of bed in the morning... She may say it is so, but Understand, it is never, ever so.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory entered the Tavern with an energy and ease they had never stepped into anywhere before…. like two young warriors who had just put their lives on the line for the first time and claimed victory in a fierce battle. Only an hour ago they’d been staring down a life behind bars... what was there to fear? Who or what could possibly Move them after a day like today? 
			As they approached the bar, a young hottie with tattoos grabbed Gregory’s arm. 
			“Hey daddy… how about a beer for the pretty lady? Hm? Buy me a beer?” yapped the hottie with an air of entitlement and expectation. 
			“Would you like my ATM number too?” Gregory replied in a calm, careless tone. 
			The girl was a bit taken aback. It was not what she expected to hear come out of this small Indian man’s mouth. 
			“Well, if you give me your ATM number, I could take you to get a haircut and maybe even get that dirty little mustache shaved off,” she challenged.</p>
