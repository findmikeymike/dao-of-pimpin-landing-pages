                <p class="student">Master, Many teachings about masculinity seem superficial. What is the deeper truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Say one did want to win her back? How should he go about it? I’m not speaking of this woman, just in general.” 
			“Oh not this woman?! Ha! Now you think you are deceiving me—and the other men around you—but you are only deceiving and confusing Yourself ... and this is the great trap of Dishonesty. A man on the Path must do all he can to be clear, open, honest, and Real with himself and others—as tough as it may be at times. For in every act of deception a seed of its own Undoing is planted. No lie will go unaccounted for. In regard to ‘winning’ the woman back, what kind of prize is spoiled milk? You ‘win’ her back… and what? You think this woman would ever have any respect and loyalty to such a cowardly man? That her behavior would magically change? Your relationship with this woman is over. Done. Thank her whatever she Revealed to you about Yourself, and move on with your life. Men spend so much of their fragile time dealing with some thing of the past, rekindling an old affair with some sub-par woman, and little do they realize they are only digging a deeper hole for themselves. They will do anything to delay the inevitable pain, and only torture themselves more.” 
			The Master paused for a beat. 
			“Keep in mind this Truth: the reason you are so stuck on her is because she is the one you encountered. There are literally millions of women on this Earth that had you met in that very same moment you met this woman, you would be just as in love with, just as broken over. Your pain and pining is because your Mechanical Mind sees a distorted Reality. You think it is about her, everything is about her, when it is really about You.”
			The Master stepped to the very front of the stage and spoke very solemnly.
			“She is only a key… a key that unlocks a space of love and beauty within Yourself. The Love, the Beauty, the Feeling… the entire journey… it is happening from Within You… A man must make and use his own key.. for if he lets the woman—or the world be his key, he will be on The Ride for eternity.”</p>
