                <p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">That afternoon, as Raul mopped the scum off the floor of the Lake Crest Motel’s bathroom, his mind spun in every direction. He pawed at his eyes, but the strange blue tint cast over his world would not wane. 
			A grossly overweight man with a tacky gold watch and sweat stains under his armpits entered the bathroom and approached one of the urinals. It was Raul’s boss, and though Raul was standing right in front of him, he did not acknowledge Raul... Furthermore, he had such little care for Raul’s presence that as he stood at the urinal, he passed gas, twice. Upon noticing the immaculately clean ground beneath his feet, he whipped his pecker to the side and shot a stream of urine right down the wall. As the urine began to form a small pool on the floor, he turned his head and acknowledged Raul…</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“And now here you are, trying your best to pacify this sea of emotions, and win this woman’s affections back, and like the simp that you are, you waste the next six hours in a state of high anxiety, trying to find something clever to say to rekindle the fire with this woman. You’re sure you’ve got it… oh yeah. You’ve got it this time… and you hit the send… and the hands of the clock start ticking so slowly, they’re damn near going in reverse. Twenty minutes… two hours… the fear builds… eight hours… three days… and nothing. Not a word. You played out the sequence of an entire relationship with a girl you didn’t know from a hole in the ground, and the whole thing was a mirage, a head trip… You were on The Ride… from fear to love, from love to fear... And so usually you take a cold shower and chalk it up as another loss, bite down on the pain… another heartbreak in that bag you carry, a little more dead weight laid up on your spirit. But this time, this time is different, because not only were you watching it happen, you were feeling it happen, and you were beginning to Understand the Motion… the Language. And so like the crafty and stubborn and determined man that you are, the next one comes along and you flip the script. Beat for beat, you flip the fucking script. Right at the peak of the warmth and excitement, right when she sends you so many goddamn emojis you start to think the girl may have schizophrenia, right at the zenith of the Love and heat… you disappear… Nowhere to be found… And The Ride is in motion…”
			“But Master, surely the man with the classic smile and warm scent does have the advantage… You cannot tell me that wasn’t part of her attraction?” said an ambivalent man in the back.
			“I am teaching you real Magic, known and Understood by one man in ten thousand, and you’re still asking about the fellow with the classic smile and tangerine scent? Do you see what I mean when I say men miss the forest for the trees? Yes the man with the sharp smile does have an advantage. He, like you, has a false sense of the what the woman truly desires. He has been told his entire life that his beautiful face was the thing that truly spoke to the heart of a Woman, and therefore, rather conveniently, tricked himself into a conviction and confidence that allowed him to be at ease around women.”
			The Master turned and looked directly at the ambivalent man.
			 “I am not telling you that a woman does not have eyes, or can’t see a man with a perfectly symmetrical face, chiseled chest, strong arms and feel no Want. Yes, she absolutely may feel some tingle in her loins, have a visceral reaction, but I am telling you that her hither brains are taking those as signals… signals for something that she senses may lie under the surface… a man at ease with himself, a man with the power to Move her. I’m telling you that if that beefcake does not Move her emotions, and I get seven minutes alone with her in the back of some dimly lit dive bar, she will be rubbing my belly and calling me daddy in the bed of the nearest roach motel before one of you can say “But his abs!” 
			The Master shook his gut with both hands and continued.
			“Do you understand? What I am telling you is that a woman will adjust the way she Sees you to match the way that you make her feel…Listen carefully. I said a woman will adjust the way she sees you to match the way that you make here FEEL. Understand that sex appeal does not happen in the gym, it happens in the heart… in the attitude, in the energy. Take the ugliest motherfucker in this room, and if his Pimpin is tight enough, I’m telling you within twenty minutes she can be looking at him like he was the genetic spawn of Leonardo DiCaprio and Beyonce. Where’s my little Indian friend? Yes, even you Kapul.”
			“My name is not Kapul, it is Gregory, Master,” said the Indian man meekly.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Who is next? You, Judas, what is it you fear?”			
			“I fear being conned by Snakes who claim to know the Way,” he snipped back with a deadly spite.
			“And yet you have no awareness that You are the true con of your own narrative. Your mind is a fortress of fear, on a suicide mission to Prove… Always trying to Prove… For the man so enslaved in this hellish realm misses the Whole of Life, held captive by the claws of his own ego. He wants so desperately to be shaken, to be woken from his slumber but his pride is so booming and monstrous, it drowns outs every ringing bell.”
			“Kiss - my - ass - you old coon,” Judas spit back.
			The room froze. All eyes turned to The Master. His face was carved from stone—utterly devoid of any emotion. With a piercing calm, he hiked up his velvet pants, stepped to the edge of the stage, and dropped his old bones over the lip. He moved with purpose now—skirting around the rows of chairs like a serpent coiling its prey. With each footstep, the room seemed to shift. More force. More weight. More speed. Then he lurched—a full bodied surge—straight toward Judas, never breaking his searing gaze on the man for a second. The congregation of men were on edge of their seats. Their fear and awe of the moment hung in the air.. 
			With each step closer the Master came, Judas’s testicles shrank three millimeters. The muscles in his body began to clench so tightly they were on the verge of incineration. His gelled hair was so brittle you could hear the crackling and smoldering. 
			As the Master closed in, Judas began to shake violently. He squeezed his eyes shut and clenched at his guts, summoning every atom of strength not to shit himself… and then…  in the infinite silence and black of his mind, he felt something… in his ear… a deep penetration—slimy, turbulent, relentless. He whimpered in helpless agony as the walls of his canal were stretched and shredded. As the penetration came to its climax, he heard the pitched-down laughter and chanting of the men, and a faint robotic voice shout:
			“W E T   W I L L Y ! ! !”
			Judas crumbled. His body, his mind, his soul… violated and pillaged in slow motion, pumped and dumped by an ungodly force.
			“Judas, the fun is over. I have finished. Now Open - Your - Eyes,” The Master said softly.  
			With a pounding breath, Judas timidly cracked open his left eye. The Master grabbed him forcefully by the cheeks, and with his face mere centimeters from Judas’s, he commanded:
			“It is time to Wake Up my boy. You do not know why you came here today, but I do… You came for this moment. For this very. fucking. moment.”
			The Master let go of his cheeks and began to ease his face away from Judas’s ever so slowly. As the Master walked back to the stage he shouted buoyantly and clapped his hands.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Master you speak oft of the Mission, the purpose of man, but truth be told I do not understand what this concept is really about. What is a man like me to do with himself, as surely a woman will sense I am mission-less?” said the pudgy lispy man.
			“First of all, know that your logic is not just backwards on a surface level, it is broken at its core. Man does not take on the Mission or pursue purpose to amuse or lure a woman. The woman literally has nothing to do with this. We will get back to the woman but know  this… man takes on the Mission for himself, and for his own evolution. So let us start by understanding first what Mission truly is and why it is imperative to every man’s journey. Listen to me closely... the Mission is the vessel for man’s evolution… on the mission, man throws himself into the the world of the unknown, to a space beyond his understandings, and outside the boundaries and limitations of mundane human “existence.” It is in the great rapids and storms of this world where the ordinary, Mechanical Mind is plundered and shattered as man moves from a state of passivity to Action.. He moves from a place of merely Existing, and reacting to the world around him—to Being, where he becomes the Action behind the world around him. He transforms from an observer of life to a Creator of life… from the Field to the Force... It is in this transformation that he Realizes many great Truths: that he is not ‘in’ the world, the world is in him. His life is not chaos or coincidence, it is of his making and his alone! For this is the great creative force the Almighty Pimp has bestowed upon man. Do you follow?’
			The congregation of men nodded in unison.
			“On the Mission, a man is tested over and over again as to whether he truly Understands these things, for if he does, he will never balk or surrender at the obstacles and set backs along the Way, as he is aware they are all of his own creation and immaculately placed opportunities he has created to prove himself to Himself! He becomes aware of his narrative and the archetypes around him. He sees the femme fatale clear as day, using her tight waist and big knockers to try to lore him back into the patterns of the lower, Mechanical Mind. He recognizes the Mentor, the unlikely figure offering wisdom and clues to his further evolution. He goes to war with his own Fear, the true Villain of his story… And with each progressive chapter of his journey, the Mechanical Mind begins to crumble and give way to the New Mind… For this is the evolution from man to Pimp.”
			“But Sir... I craft sandwiches at a local sub shop,” the pudge replied.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Truthfully Lou… I have had a very long day but maybe another time,” Raul replied. 
			“Well, I had a great time with you and would love to see you again.. when are you free?” 
			“Aw hmm… You know I have a lot going on the next two weeks, but let’s keep in touch.” 
			It wasn’t that Raul lacked interest in her, it was just that he had much bigger things on his mind at the moment, and he Understood there was no rush. He would let the woman’s imagination and time preheat the oven as he attended to his next course of Action in life and on the Mission at hand.</p>
