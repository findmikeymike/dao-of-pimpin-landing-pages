                <p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Raul, the Eternal Simp, leaned over the ledge of his third-floor balcony. He was half-drunk and fully spent: spent for the night, for life—all of it. Raul knew the leap from twenty-five feet up wouldn’t be enough to kill him dead; he did, however, have a brief fantasy of his life as a paraplegic and the potential beauty it would entail. He envisioned a wild and passionate romance with his caretaker: a young, illiterate Hispanic nurse. She would tend to his wounds and in soft, broken English whisper her admirations in his ear. He had received a Purple Heart after all, for demonstrating unwavering bravery and perseverance as a prisoner of war, held captive for twenty years by pathological women and shrapnel-spewing whores… Raul’s first and second wives had cheated on him with other low-level service employees. His third, Isabel, left in the night never to be seen or heard from again. His fourth, he caught red-handed fucking Richard Pew, a 73-year-old bisexual and regionally famous magician. 
			What decent man deserved this horrific fate? What past life karma could possibly spawn such relentless calamity? How is it that other men have such good goddamn fortune? Like the lemon he was, Raul slunk away from the railing, retreated to his bedroom, masturbated for twelve minutes, and fell asleep, hoping tomorrow was the day his fate would turn.
     		 The next morning, the sky was a deep purple. Raul awoke to the crackle of heavy rain. He began his morning routine: he trimmed his whiskers, ironed his janitorial coveralls, ate a lightly toasted bagel with store-brand jam, and retrieved the mail from his letterbox. As Raul shuffled through a swarm of bills and tomfoolery, his eye was caught by a fluorescent blue envelope. Something about its hue felt menacing and hypnotic— enchanting, but not to be trusted. He was in no mood for another one of life’s grifts. 
			Raul set the envelope aside with all the other junk mail and continued to sift through the pile but the strange blue screamed and hissed in the corner of his eye. Ignore its allure Raul! There is nothing but trouble in there! But… what fortune may be held within, Raul? Oh get real, Raul! It’s probably the crafty little Asian children from floor two trying to recruit you for another grueling summer of trumpet lessons! 
			As the war raged in his head—his hands—apparently oblivious to the chaos, tore the envelope open. With one eye cracked, he reached in and swiftly yanked out a small notecard with five italicized serif words ‘The Master Returns to America.’ Raul’s mouth fell open. The notecard quivered violently in his hand, its words blurring in and out of focus as a rolling thunder shook the room.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Who is next? You, Judas, what is it you fear?”			
			“I fear being conned by Snakes who claim to know the Way,” he snipped back with a deadly spite.
			“And yet you have no awareness that You are the true con of your own narrative. Your mind is a fortress of fear, on a suicide mission to Prove… Always trying to Prove… For the man so enslaved in this hellish realm misses the Whole of Life, held captive by the claws of his own ego. He wants so desperately to be shaken, to be woken from his slumber but his pride is so booming and monstrous, it drowns outs every ringing bell.”
			“Kiss - my - ass - you old coon,” Judas spit back.
			The room froze. All eyes turned to The Master. His face was carved from stone—utterly devoid of any emotion. With a piercing calm, he hiked up his velvet pants, stepped to the edge of the stage, and dropped his old bones over the lip. He moved with purpose now—skirting around the rows of chairs like a serpent coiling its prey. With each footstep, the room seemed to shift. More force. More weight. More speed. Then he lurched—a full bodied surge—straight toward Judas, never breaking his searing gaze on the man for a second. The congregation of men were on edge of their seats. Their fear and awe of the moment hung in the air.. 
			With each step closer the Master came, Judas’s testicles shrank three millimeters. The muscles in his body began to clench so tightly they were on the verge of incineration. His gelled hair was so brittle you could hear the crackling and smoldering. 
			As the Master closed in, Judas began to shake violently. He squeezed his eyes shut and clenched at his guts, summoning every atom of strength not to shit himself… and then…  in the infinite silence and black of his mind, he felt something… in his ear… a deep penetration—slimy, turbulent, relentless. He whimpered in helpless agony as the walls of his canal were stretched and shredded. As the penetration came to its climax, he heard the pitched-down laughter and chanting of the men, and a faint robotic voice shout:
			“W E T   W I L L Y ! ! !”
			Judas crumbled. His body, his mind, his soul… violated and pillaged in slow motion, pumped and dumped by an ungodly force.
			“Judas, the fun is over. I have finished. Now Open - Your - Eyes,” The Master said softly.  
			With a pounding breath, Judas timidly cracked open his left eye. The Master grabbed him forcefully by the cheeks, and with his face mere centimeters from Judas’s, he commanded:
			“It is time to Wake Up my boy. You do not know why you came here today, but I do… You came for this moment. For this very. fucking. moment.”
			The Master let go of his cheeks and began to ease his face away from Judas’s ever so slowly. As the Master walked back to the stage he shouted buoyantly and clapped his hands.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">The metal chairs screeched in agony as the men pushed them aside and dove to the floor. 	Raul’s head hit the musky floor, inches from Gregory’s. He couldn’t help but notice the thousand microscopic beads of sweat sliding down Gregory’s mini mustache. 
			“Do you think… think this may be… a test, brother?” Gregory whispered as soft as a mouse. 
			“A test! Did you see the Fear in Master’s eyes? These are Federal Agents, Gregory! This is no theatre,” Raul hissed back. 
			Gregory squeezed his eyes shut and began to pant. The armed men had surrounded them now, their rifles aimed to kill. 
			There were six armed men on stage surrounding the Master. Two of the men grabbed the Master’s arms from behind with violent force, slamming cuffs on his wrists. The Master wailed in agony.  The leader of the Fed team knelt down in front of the Master and snarled,</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Sammy Davis Jr., you are under arrest by the Federal Police of Justice for high crimes of the many. You have the right to remain silent as I hereby announce these crimes. Under the newly passed Federal Women’s Protection Act, in effect April 16th, pursuant code 769BBC, “Pimping" in all of its forms comes with a life sentence… The crimes you have committed under the umbrella of this law include: One… Unlawful disclosure of the Woman’s Psychology. Two… Manipulation of Historical Sexual Dynamics. Three… Radicalizing and Sexually Weaponizing Males. Four… Collecting money in Women Endangering Pursuits… last but not least, Five— using the word “Faggot” and “bitch” among other terms deemed unlawful. We have all of this on tape.” 
			The Master dropped his head and began to sob. 
			“But… but... I’m Black?" he whimpered.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“You can tell that to the judge,” the Head Fed snipped back. He turned to the group of men. 
			“Now as for you gentlemen… you too, have broken many serious new laws that come with stiff penalties and serious jail time. These laws include: One— Payment for Information Endangering Women… Two— Actively pursuing and engaging with a known Pimp… Three— Pursuing Pimpdom… Now I will present you with two options. You may plead negligence based on the newness of this law, verbally rebuke Pimpdom and your activities here today, and agree to reveal the financial details and all payments made to Mr. Sammy Davis Jr., to be used against in the court of law… or you can face the Law yourself, and continue your pursuits with Mr. Davis behind cold, metal bars for decades to come. I will now ask that the compliers of my first request come stand over here on the left side of the room with our agents.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">After fifty minutes, the van finally came to a halt and the doors swung open. By the bustling and busyness of the street outside it was clear they were in the downtown of a city, but anyone’s guess as to where exactly. 
			The federal agents grabbed the three men and yanked them out of the van. As they were steered into an old, brick building and prodded up a flight of stairs, the agents railed at them.
			“Move! Hurry it up, you fucking degenerates! We don’t have all day.”
			At the top of the stairs, the agents shoed them into a small, square room with plain white walls. Cameras in each corner stared down at them, poised to broadcast their images on the local late-night news as the most wicked and dangerous of men.
			The Head Fed followed the Master, Raul, and Gregory inside and shut the door behind them. In the middle of the room stood a black table and three brown envelopes, each tagged with their names. 
			“Gentlemen, inside each of these envelopes we have the official documentation and proof of each of your crimes. Now Mr. Davis won’t be going anywhere... but because I am an extremely forgiving man, I am going to give you two scoundrels one last opportunity to rebuke your crimes and agree to testify against Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.... and if you are willing to comply, you may go on your way,” the Head Fed said addressing Raul and Gregory. 
			“You heard the man. Do not be fools… my fate is already sealed, the show is over… go on your way,” said the Master.</p>
