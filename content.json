      "content": "<p class=\"student\">Master, Many teachings about masculinity seem superficial. What is the deeper truth?</p>\n\n<p class=\"master\">\u201cYou missed a spot,\u201d he snarled. \n\t\t\tRaul\u2019s blood began to boil. He had a fleeting vision of cracking the man over the head with the handle of his mop and flushing his remains down the toilet. It was not the first time he had been treated with such disrespect and contempt by his boss, but it was the most brash, and as infuriated as he was in the moment, there was a part of him that felt it was deserved. You are thirty-eight years old Raul! And this is how you spend your precious life? Cleaning toilets and replacing light bulbs for barbarians! Slaving away for pennies! It\u2019s been twenty years now, Raul! Get it together!\n\t\t\tThere was a more hopeful time in Raul\u2019s life when he did have a Dream. He had grand and lucid visions of his very own janitorial company, \u2018Delgado\u2019s Diligent Cleaning.\u2019 The most esteemed and prestigious cleaning service in all of Little Rock. Raul could see in vivid, crystallized color a satellite view of his vans crawling on every corner of the city. He saw people at stop lights giving the thumbs up to his workers and the occasional woman flashing her bosoms in the front yard as he passed in the \u2018Boss Van\u2019. He saw warm, pink suds soaking into terminally ill carpet, and a time-lapse of their resuscitations to a youthful vigor. \n\t\t\tBut as the gears of the galaxy churned on, and the years passed, and the hell-raising women crept in the cracks of his sad life to tap the last of his blood, the color and clarity of Raul\u2019s visions faded away, leaving behind only the carcass of a Dream.. a pile of bones and a few shreds of dried meat. He needed a win in life, something\u2026 anything... to give him a bit of faith and keep him Going. \n\t\t\tRaul pulled out of the Lake Crest parking lot and  floored it. His \u201987 Volvo shrieked and wailed as it barreled down the open road, rattling maniacally as it surged to its top speed. The odometer read thirty-eight miles per hour. With the motel and all of its horror finally out of sight, Raul dug into his pocket, pulled out the mystical notecard, and placed it in his lap. He gently stroked the card with his thumb, over and over, as if to ensure its secrets would not escape. The cars behind him on the single lane road beeped in agony, just as they always did. \u201cForget them, Raul! Stay focused\u2026 You may just be holding the ticket to a new life, Raul!\u201d he thought to himself. In four short days, he would have his answer.</p>\n\n"

      "description": "Authentic wisdom from The Dao of Pimpin on masculinity. \u201cLet us start at the beginning: You simps open your mouth to speak to a woman, and she is not moved. Hell, she\u2019s usually appalled. She looks into your eyes...",
      "slug": "masculinity-5",
      "content": "<p class=\"student\">Master, How can I develop true attraction?</p>\n\n<p class=\"master\">\u201cAnd now here you are, trying your best to pacify this sea of emotions, and win this woman\u2019s affections back, and like the simp that you are, you waste the next six hours in a state of high anxiety, trying to find something clever to say to rekindle the fire with this woman. You\u2019re sure you\u2019ve got it\u2026 oh yeah. You\u2019ve got it this time\u2026 and you hit the send\u2026 and the hands of the clock start ticking so slowly, they\u2019re damn near going in reverse. Twenty minutes\u2026 two hours\u2026 the fear builds\u2026 eight hours\u2026 three days\u2026 and nothing. Not a word. You played out the sequence of an entire relationship with a girl you didn\u2019t know from a hole in the ground, and the whole thing was a mirage, a head trip\u2026 You were on The Ride\u2026 from fear to love, from love to fear... And so usually you take a cold shower and chalk it up as another loss, bite down on the pain\u2026 another heartbreak in that bag you carry, a little more dead weight laid up on your spirit. But this time, this time is different, because not only were you watching it happen, you were feeling it happen, and you were beginning to Understand the Motion\u2026 the Language. And so like the crafty and stubborn and determined man that you are, the next one comes along and you flip the script. Beat for beat, you flip the fucking script. Right at the peak of the warmth and excitement, right when she sends you so many goddamn emojis you start to think the girl may have schizophrenia, right at the zenith of the Love and heat\u2026 you disappear\u2026 Nowhere to be found\u2026 And The Ride is in motion\u2026\u201d\n\t\t\t\u201cBut Master, surely the man with the classic smile and warm scent does have the advantage\u2026 You cannot tell me that wasn\u2019t part of her attraction?\u201d said an ambivalent man in the back.\n\t\t\t\u201cI am teaching you real Magic, known and Understood by one man in ten thousand, and you\u2019re still asking about the fellow with the classic smile and tangerine scent? Do you see what I mean when I say men miss the forest for the trees? Yes the man with the sharp smile does have an advantage. He, like you, has a false sense of the what the woman truly desires. He has been told his entire life that his beautiful face was the thing that truly spoke to the heart of a Woman, and therefore, rather conveniently, tricked himself into a conviction and confidence that allowed him to be at ease around women.\u201d\n\t\t\tThe Master turned and looked directly at the ambivalent man.\n\t\t\t \u201cI am not telling you that a woman does not have eyes, or can\u2019t see a man with a perfectly symmetrical face, chiseled chest, strong arms and feel no Want. Yes, she absolutely may feel some tingle in her loins, have a visceral reaction, but I am telling you that her hither brains are taking those as signals\u2026 signals for something that she senses may lie under the surface\u2026 a man at ease with himself, a man with the power to Move her. I\u2019m telling you that if that beefcake does not Move her emotions, and I get seven minutes alone with her in the back of some dimly lit dive bar, she will be rubbing my belly and calling me daddy in the bed of the nearest roach motel before one of you can say \u201cBut his abs!\u201d \n\t\t\tThe Master shook his gut with both hands and continued.\n\t\t\t\u201cDo you understand? What I am telling you is that a woman will adjust the way she Sees you to match the way that you make her feel\u2026Listen carefully. I said a woman will adjust the way she sees you to match the way that you make here FEEL. Understand that sex appeal does not happen in the gym, it happens in the heart\u2026 in the attitude, in the energy. Take the ugliest motherfucker in this room, and if his Pimpin is tight enough, I\u2019m telling you within twenty minutes she can be looking at him like he was the genetic spawn of Leonardo DiCaprio and Beyonce. Where\u2019s my little Indian friend? Yes, even you Kapul.\u201d\n\t\t\t\u201cMy name is not Kapul, it is Gregory, Master,\u201d said the Indian man meekly.</p>\n\n"

      "slug": "masculinity-7",
      "content": "<p class=\"student\">Master, What is the essence of confidence according to the Dao?</p>\n\n<p class=\"master\">\u201cYes, exactly\u2026 because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails\u2014she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers\u2014the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap\u2026 their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.\u201d\n\t\t\tThe Master paused for a beat.\n\t\t\t\u201cAre we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?\u201d\n\t\t\tThe flock nodded. \n\t\t\tThe Master continued.\n\t\t\t\u201cTwenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, \u201cCome, it\u2019s time you show me how to dance.\u201d Notice the way this man Moves\u2014fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature\u2014vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure\u2014and the \u2018proving\u2019\u2014on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old \u2018man impresses woman\u2019 adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.\u201d\n\t\t\tThe Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.\n\t\t\t\"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist\u2014no hesitation, no fear\u2014and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor\u2026 alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it\u2026 for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself\u2014whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who\u2019s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. \u2018Take me, you wild stallion,\u2019 she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye\u2026 the soft glow of her skin\u2026 \u2018It is time,\u2019 he says to himself. So the man\u2014\u2019\u2019\n\t\t\tA lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically\u2014 \n\t\t\t\u201cSir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I\u2019m sure you understand Master!\u201d \n\t\t\tThe Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. \n\t\t\t\u201cWhich one of these men next to you is erect?\u201d howled The Master.\n\t\t\t\u201cIt is I, Master.\u201d murmured a soft voice. \n\t\t\tThe man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,\n\t\t\t\u201cIf any consolation, sir\u2026 gentleman\u2026 I don\u2019t believe it is a gay erection\u2026 it is just that Master\u2019s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual\u2026 he captured my emotions and I apologize,\u201d he said softly.\n\t\t\tThe Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. \n\t\t\t\u201cApologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here\u2026 Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings\u2026 we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or\u2026 purely mechanical,\u201d the Master said calmly. \n\t\t\tThe Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. \n\t\t\t\u201cYou may move your seat... six inches closer to him.\u201d \n\t\t\t\u201cSir?\u201d gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. \n\t\t\t\u201cYou heard me\u2026 his little erection is not going to harm you\u2026 you said where you\u2019re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,\u201d quipped the Master. \n\t\t\t\u201cSir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!\u201d said the man, now on the verge of tears.\n \t\t\t\u201cThen leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!\u201d \n\t\t\tThe Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.\n\t\t\t\u201cLet us proceed\u2026 where did we leave off?\u201d said the Master. \n\t\t\t\u201cMaster, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels\u2026 dare I say\u2026 sinister\u2026 or Machiavellian,\u201d a man replied.\n\t\t\t\u201cWhat you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself\u2026 do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man\u2026 You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.\u201d\n\t\t\t\u201cBut Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?\u201d objected the man.</p>\n\n"

For if we were to let you loose on these streets\u2026 a savage like you\u2026 the rest of us would have to fight just for a chance to bend over that dead bird in the bush.\u201d \n\t\t\tThe Master began to chuckle, and the men joined him.

He stared out at the men with a piercing and violent mania in his eyes. The men\u2019s laughter seized so quickly it sounded as if someone had clicked a mute button on the room. They snapped back into upright position. Their pounding hearts and wavering breathes scored the silence like a symphony. The mania and madness in the Master\u2019s eyes quickly faded back to a brilliant shimmer as he snickered, \n\t\t\t\u201cSee what I did there? I took you for the Round Trip\u2026 The ol Pimp Special\u2026 Did you catch that Kapul?\u201d \n\t\t\t\u201cYes Master, believe it or not.. in the bliss of the moment, I had a strange feeling you were going to vault the energy and emotion of the room into a new direction.

No\u2026 she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won\u2019t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night\u2019s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death\u2014like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun\u2014detonates in the air.

Speak up!\u201d said the Master. \n\t\t\t\u201cTo\u2026 to\u2026 be put\u2026 on the spot\u2026 to speak pu\u2026 publicly.\u201d he stammered. \n\t\t\t\u201cAh! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly\u2026 and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me\u2026 Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night\u2026 the shame, the guilt\u2026 you cannot run from it\u2026 it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go \u2018on the spot\u2019 more\u2026 and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root\u2026 and like a hellish weed, it will rear it\u2019s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender\u2026 Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?\u201d\n\t\t\tThe little ginger man\u2019s face turned blood red. \n\t\t\t\u201cGinger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre\u2026 tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.\u201d \n\t\t\tThe little ginger man made an \u2018Okay\u2019 gesture with his hand and nodded his head. \n\t\t\t\u201cSay it out loud! Let us hear your voice!\u201d\n\t\t\t\u201cOkay,\u201d said the man sheepishly.\n\t\t\t\u201cWe do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!\u201d howled the Master.\n\t\t\t\u201cOKAY,\u201d the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>\n\n<p class=\"student\">Master, I've been struggling with masculinity. Can you share your wisdom on this?</p>\n\n<p class=\"master\">\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Judas, everybody!\u201d\n\t\t\tThe men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on \u201cThe Price is Right.\u201d \n\t\t\tJudas\u2019s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas\u2014 the last scene in the film of \u201cWho he Thought He Was.\u201d The credits rolled.\n\t\t\tRaul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he\u2019d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him\u2014empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. \n\t\t\tThe Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. \n\t\t\t\u201cNow, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes\u2026 The Fear! Let\u2019s take one more look... with you Gregory\u2026 of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?\u201d \n\t\t\t\u201cIn classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...\u201d \n\t\t\t\u201cIronically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, \u2018Father I have quit my job!

After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man\u2019s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents\u2019 Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.\u201d</p>\n\n"

      "content": "<p class=\"student\">Master, I'm confused about attraction. Can you clarify this for me?</p>\n\n<p class=\"master\">\u201cSo he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself \u2018the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,\u2019 so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: \u2018The first five rounds are on you.\u2019 Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn\u2019t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn\u2019t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn\u2019t for another two weeks\u2014suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?\u201d\n\t\t\t\u201cI am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!\u201d Gregory shouted without hesitation.\n\t\t\t\u201cYes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.\u2019 This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of \u2018losing\u2019 some girl he doesn\u2019t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.\u201d\n\t\t\t\u201cSir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women\u2026 but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?\u201d replied a curious believer.\n\t\t\t\u201cNo, no, no\u2026 you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I\u2019m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from\u2026 a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call\u2026 I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot\u2026 there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself \u2018How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?\u2019 You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.\u201d  \n\t\t\t\u201cSo I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?\u201d replied the man.\n\t\t\t\u201cNo\u2014on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection\u2026 for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp\u2019s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man\u2019s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.\u201d</p>\n\n"

You craft sandwiches\u2026 and you say that as if it is an empty pursuit\u2026 a realm that holds no potential for any kind of evolution or magic... but let me tell you the potential Mission of man comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. It is not in the \u201cwhat man does\u201d but in the \u201chow he does it.\u201d Do not think that Mission means a man must start a multi-million dollar company, or win an Oscar, or reach some fantastical level of social status. You may have a man that\u2019s truest calling in life is simply to Teach... maybe his passion is for history and he teaches a middle school class. What matters is the hunger, relentlessness, and creativity he approaches his teaching with. How far he is willing to push to be the most legendary teacher that ever walked the Earth? Let me ask you\u2026 why do you spend your life making sandwiches?\u201d \n\t\t\t\u201cBecause it pays a fair wage sir, and I get joy in seeing people eat.

Tsk Tsk,\u201d The Master snickered. \n\t\t\t\u201cHe was not really gay, Master,\u201d said the man. \n\t\t\t\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019m aware,\u201d replied the Master. He continued.\n\t\t\t\u201cMaybe the woman lied about you being the \u2018love of her life\u2019 and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life\u2026 But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It\u2019s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn\u2019t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol\u2019 simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.\u201d\n\t\t\t\u201cSo that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!\u201d laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.\n\t\t\t\u201cLet us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard\u2026 you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn\u2019t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of \u2018all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.\u201d</p>\n\n"

For in every act of deception a seed of its own Undoing is planted. No lie will go unaccounted for. In regard to \u2018winning\u2019 the woman back, what kind of prize is spoiled milk? You \u2018win\u2019 her back\u2026 and what? You think this woman would ever have any respect and loyalty to such a cowardly man? That her behavior would magically change?

The tatted hottie\u2019s cheeks flushed florescent pink, and though she was emotionally aroused and intrigued by such boldness and wit from the most unexpected of men, she could not keep up with his Dance, and defaulted to a front of offense. \n\t\t\t\u201cWow\u2026 you really just said that?\u201d she muttered dully. \n\t\t\t\u201cYou heard daddy, and unless you want his named tattooed on the low of your back, I suggest you play nice with him. How about you use that womanly wile of yours and go snatch all three of us a drink. That should be no challenge for a girl like you. We\u2019ll wait here,\u201d Raul poked coyly. \n\t\t\t\u201cOh, me go get the drinks? You two are quite the duo\u2026 the chivalry!\u201d She shook her head, half-frazzled, half-bemused, and retreated to her friend. \n\t\t\tHer friend was watching the encounter, appraising the men with her own growing curiosity. Who were they? Why were they so cool and unaffected? How many hearts must they have conquered to gain such wit and indifference? \n\t\t\tRaul slung his arm around Gregory\u2019s shoulder and they turned towards the bar\u2014completely unfazed by the women\u2019s exit. \n\t\t\t\u201cTwo whiskeys, hard and straight, mam,\u201d Gregory said to the bartender. \n\t\t\tThe bartender poured heavy glasses and slid them across the bar. Raul and Gregory grabbed their drinks and clinked them. \n\t\t\t\u201cTo the Path. To the Master. To the Mission. To fucking the shit out of this strange, beautiful life...\u201d exclaimed Raul.</p>\n\n"

He would let the woman\u2019s imagination and time preheat the oven as he attended to his next course of Action in life and on the Mission at hand.</p>\n\n"

      "content": "<p class=\"student\">Master, Many teachings about masculinity seem superficial. What is the deeper truth?</p>\n\n<p class=\"master\">Raul the Pimp,\u2028\t\tLet the contents of this envelope serve you on \n\tThe Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"student\">Master, can you explain this teaching more deeply? I'm trying to understand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"master\">Raul stared blankly at the check for a moment. Part of him was in disbelief, as if he had dreamed whole charade.. He ran his finger softly down the spine of the check and accepted the Moment for what it was\u2026 a blessing, a new beginning\u2026 another shot at Life and the Dream.\n\t\t\t Raul walked over to the closet and began shuffling through stacks of old magazines. He stopped and pulled out a worn catalog: Janitorial Worldwide. Flipping through it quickly, he stopped on a page with a faded bookmark. On the marked page was a picture of a high-tech janitorial van. Inside the van was an entire array of state-of-the-art cleaning tools and machinery. \n\t\t\tRaul pulled out his phone and dialed. It rang once, and then clicked over to a voice message.\n\t\t\t\u201cHello, this is Raul Delgado. I\u2019d like to place an order for two SCV7\u2019s... And if at all possible, I would like to have flaming vacuums painted on the sides of both\u2026 and my logo of course\u2026 Please call me at 323-457-8794.\u201d \n\t\t\tAfter hanging up, he retrieved the check off the table, slid it into his wallet\u2014then paused. Something else caught his eye inside. He pulled out a small card, read the number, and dialed. It rang four times before a familiar voice snapped:\n\t\t\t\u201cWho the fuck ca\u2014\" barked the voice\u2014But before the man could finish he was steamrolled by the cool and impassioned Pimp Raul.\n\t\t\t\u201cYes boss. This is Raul Delgado from Lake Crest\u2026 yes, Raul... I\u2019m aware it\u2019s 2 A.M... I figured it is the hour your wife gets the most horney sir\u2026 and seeing as it is a sheer impossibility she could ever get to your little dick under all that disgusting, hideous flubber, I was wondering if I dropped by and gave her some real pipe, the pipe she dreams about all day long, if you wouldn\u2019t consider a promotion and handsome raise for me sir?\u201d\n\t\t\tRaul\u2019s eyes glowed like a sacred fire. He had tapped fully into a flow state of Fearless Presence as he spoke,\n\t\t\t\u201cFired, sir? Kill me, sir? How dare you\u2026 I offer a favor, and this is how you repay me?!\u201d \n\t\t\tRaul hung up the phone and let out a primal wail of the most joyous laughter. It rang through the halls of his apartment like a war cry and an exorcism. Like a true Pimp, he slowly reclined back into his couch with a big old shit-eating grin stretched across his face. \t\t\t\tHe was a man reclaiming his legend\u2014the same legend buried in every man, burning to be Remembered. Some will hear the Call. Others will be taken for the Ride. But in the end, there is only One Real Question every man must answer: Are you a Pimp\u2026 or a bitch?</p>\n\n"
