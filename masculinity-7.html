                <div class="content-text">
                    <p class="student">Master, What is the essence of confidence according to the Dao?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, exactly… because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails—she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers—the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap… their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.”
			The Master paused for a beat.
			“Are we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?”
			The flock nodded. 
			The Master continued.
			“Twenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, “Come, it’s time you show me how to dance.” Notice the way this man Moves—fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature—vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure—and the ‘proving’—on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old ‘man impresses woman’ adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.”
			The Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.
			"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist—no hesitation, no fear—and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor… alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it… for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself—whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who’s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. ‘Take me, you wild stallion,’ she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye… the soft glow of her skin… ‘It is time,’ he says to himself. So the man—’’
			A lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically— 
			“Sir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I’m sure you understand Master!” 
			The Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. 
			“Which one of these men next to you is erect?” howled The Master.
			“It is I, Master.” murmured a soft voice. 
			The man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,
			“If any consolation, sir… gentleman… I don’t believe it is a gay erection… it is just that Master’s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual… he captured my emotions and I apologize,” he said softly.
			The Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. 
			“Apologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here… Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings… we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or… purely mechanical,” the Master said calmly. 
			The Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. 
			“You may move your seat... six inches closer to him.” 
			“Sir?” gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. 
			“You heard me… his little erection is not going to harm you… you said where you’re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,” quipped the Master. 
			“Sir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!” said the man, now on the verge of tears.
 			“Then leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!” 
			The Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.
			“Let us proceed… where did we leave off?” said the Master. 
			“Master, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels… dare I say… sinister… or Machiavellian,” a man replied.
			“What you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself… do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man… You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.”
			“But Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?” objected the man.</p>
