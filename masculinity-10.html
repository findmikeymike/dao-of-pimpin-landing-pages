<div class="master-student-dialogue">
<p class="student">Master, I've been struggling with masculinity. Can you share your wisdom on this?</p>
<p class="master">“If we cut all my hair off, what will you have to run your hands through tomorrow morning?” Gregory replied with a sly charm. 
			Raul looked on with great joy and amusement. The tatted hottie’s cheeks flushed florescent pink, and though she was emotionally aroused and intrigued by such boldness and wit from the most unexpected of men, she could not keep up with his Dance, and defaulted to a front of offense. 
			“Wow… you really just said that?” she muttered dully. 
			“You heard daddy, and unless you want his named tattooed on the low of your back, I suggest you play nice with him. How about you use that womanly wile of yours and go snatch all three of us a drink. That should be no challenge for a girl like you. We’ll wait here,” Raul poked coyly. 
			“Oh, me go get the drinks? You two are quite the duo… the chivalry!” She shook her head, half-frazzled, half-bemused, and retreated to her friend. 
			Her friend was watching the encounter, appraising the men with her own growing curiosity. Who were they? Why were they so cool and unaffected? How many hearts must they have conquered to gain such wit and indifference? 
			Raul slung his arm around Gregory’s shoulder and they turned towards the bar—completely unfazed by the women’s exit. 
			“Two whiskeys, hard and straight, mam,” Gregory said to the bartender. 
			The bartender poured heavy glasses and slid them across the bar. Raul and Gregory grabbed their drinks and clinked them. 
			“To the Path. To the Master. To the Mission. To fucking the shit out of this strange, beautiful life...” exclaimed Raul.</p>
