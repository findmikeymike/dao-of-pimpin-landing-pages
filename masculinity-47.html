                <p class="student">Master, I feel like I'm overthinking masculinity. How can I approach it more naturally?</p>

<p class="master">The metal chairs screeched in agony as the men pushed them aside and dove to the floor. 	Raul’s head hit the musky floor, inches from Gregory’s. He couldn’t help but notice the thousand microscopic beads of sweat sliding down Gregory’s mini mustache. 
			“Do you think… think this may be… a test, brother?” Gregory whispered as soft as a mouse. 
			“A test! Did you see the Fear in Master’s eyes? These are Federal Agents, Gregory! This is no theatre,” Raul hissed back. 
			Gregory squeezed his eyes shut and began to pant. The armed men had surrounded them now, their rifles aimed to kill. 
			There were six armed men on stage surrounding the Master. Two of the men grabbed the Master’s arms from behind with violent force, slamming cuffs on his wrists. The Master wailed in agony.  The leader of the Fed team knelt down in front of the Master and snarled,</p>

<p class="student">Master, What is the essence of masculinity according to the Dao?</p>

<p class="master">“You can tell that to the judge,” the Head Fed snipped back. He turned to the group of men. 
			“Now as for you gentlemen… you too, have broken many serious new laws that come with stiff penalties and serious jail time. These laws include: One— Payment for Information Endangering Women… Two— Actively pursuing and engaging with a known Pimp… Three— Pursuing Pimpdom… Now I will present you with two options. You may plead negligence based on the newness of this law, verbally rebuke Pimpdom and your activities here today, and agree to reveal the financial details and all payments made to Mr. Sammy Davis Jr., to be used against in the court of law… or you can face the Law yourself, and continue your pursuits with Mr. Davis behind cold, metal bars for decades to come. I will now ask that the compliers of my first request come stand over here on the left side of the room with our agents.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I feel like I'm overthinking masculinity. How can I approach it more naturally?</p>

<p class="master">“And what matters is your Will, your Truth, and what you believe to be Right.. the world will try it’s best to push back, make you cave… but Man must conquer the Fear… he must never back down... at the end of the day there is only one real Question… will man choose Action or death. Are you a Pimp or a bitch, Raul?”</p>

<div class="key-point">
<p>Watching the Master surrender to the fear, the men spiraled into silent hysteria, and the symphony of racing hearts and shaky breathes resumed.</p>
</div>

<div class="key-point">
<p>The room was dead silent as the Master and the men listened intently.</p>
</div>

<p class="student">Master, I've read many books on masculinity, but something is missing. What am I overlooking?</p>

<p class="master">“I too stand by the Master.. I too am guilty of pursuing the Path of the Pimp—and I shall pursue it every day until death!” Gregory roared. 
			There was a heart and fullness in his voice, a depth and conviction he, nor anyone else on Earth had ever heard materialize from within him before. 
			The bitch men looked on in astonishment. As they stood on the left side of the room as “free men,” there was a part of all of them that Understood they were witnessing something special Unfolding— something that they couldn’t quite put their finger on, something their Mechanical Minds just couldn’t fully compute. 
			The agents closed in on Raul and Gregory, threw them to the ground violently, and cuffed them.</p>
