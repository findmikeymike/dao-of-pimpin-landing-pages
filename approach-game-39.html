                <p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">The men howled and whistled in excitement. The Master shot up off the ground and back into perfect lotus posture, stared straight at Kapul and with a veiled joy in his voice replied, 
			“Don’t you dare move a muscle, Kapul... For if we were to let you loose on these streets… a savage like you… the rest of us would have to fight just for a chance to bend over that dead bird in the bush.” 
			The Master began to chuckle, and the men joined him. It was a nice moment, the Master and all the men sharing a laugh, a moment of true warmth and communion, a mome— 
			“SILENCE!” roared Master. 
			His empty glass flew across the room and shattered against something hard. He stared out at the men with a piercing and violent mania in his eyes. The men’s laughter seized so quickly it sounded as if someone had clicked a mute button on the room. They snapped back into upright position. Their pounding hearts and wavering breathes scored the silence like a symphony. The mania and madness in the Master’s eyes quickly faded back to a brilliant shimmer as he snickered, 
			“See what I did there? I took you for the Round Trip… The ol Pimp Special… Did you catch that Kapul?” 
			“Yes Master, believe it or not.. in the bliss of the moment, I had a strange feeling you were going to vault the energy and emotion of the room into a new direction. Your words have not fallen on deaf ears,” Gregory replied with a quiet pride. 
			“Well I’ll be damned… maybe Kapul is He after all!”
			Gregory turned his head to the men around him with a mischievous grin. He was not the man to count out.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The Master took a deep breath and the fire returned to his voice.
			“Do you see Her now? Do you Understand the Reality of the creature that once made you tremble in fear? How could this creature ever Hurt you? What could she ever Take from you? Sear this image in your mind, picture it day and night, let it be the first thing you see in the morning, the last thing you see at night.. let it paint the skies of every dream you dream... and in time, the software of your mind that deals with women will take on a new shape, a new perception… one that is more in line with Reality… one that can immerse itself in a new Language… and as the script of this software is rewritten, the other softwares of the Mind too become more malleable, more unsure of themselves, and easier to adjust or destroy. This process is a key aspect of the evolution from man to Pimp… Now repeat after me: She is not the enemy. She is just like me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“This... sir.” said the timid ginger man with a tremble. 
			“This… this… what? Speak up!” said the Master. 
			“To… to… be put… on the spot… to speak pu… publicly.” he stammered. 
			“Ah! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly… and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me… Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night… the shame, the guilt… you cannot run from it… it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go ‘on the spot’ more… and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root… and like a hellish weed, it will rear it’s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender… Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?”
			The little ginger man’s face turned blood red. 
			“Ginger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre… tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.” 
			The little ginger man made an ‘Okay’ gesture with his hand and nodded his head. 
			“Say it out loud! Let us hear your voice!”
			“Okay,” said the man sheepishly.
			“We do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!” howled the Master.
			“OKAY,” the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Master... I… I don’t kn—“
			“Shush! You will or you won’t, Gregory. Know that in the grandest sense of it all, this is the One Real Question, the one real choice for man: Action or death. There is no halfway, no low-level pimp... One either takes Action and dives head first into the abyss or he submits to being another cog in the machine, another Mechanical Mind humming along through the scenes of life, pretending to be alive… At the heart of this all, at the core of everything said here today, understand that it is the Pimp who chooses Life, he who answers the Call with Action. You thought the Pimp was he who fucks women… I am telling you— it is the Pimp who fucks the shit out of life.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“Sammy Davis Jr., you are under arrest by the Federal Police of Justice for high crimes of the many. You have the right to remain silent as I hereby announce these crimes. Under the newly passed Federal Women’s Protection Act, in effect April 16th, pursuant code 769BBC, “Pimping" in all of its forms comes with a life sentence… The crimes you have committed under the umbrella of this law include: One… Unlawful disclosure of the Woman’s Psychology. Two… Manipulation of Historical Sexual Dynamics. Three… Radicalizing and Sexually Weaponizing Males. Four… Collecting money in Women Endangering Pursuits… last but not least, Five— using the word “Faggot” and “bitch” among other terms deemed unlawful. We have all of this on tape.” 
			The Master dropped his head and began to sob. 
			“But… but... I’m Black?" he whimpered.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“And what matters is your Will, your Truth, and what you believe to be Right.. the world will try it’s best to push back, make you cave… but Man must conquer the Fear… he must never back down... at the end of the day there is only one real Question… will man choose Action or death. Are you a Pimp or a bitch, Raul?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Truthfully Lou… I have had a very long day but maybe another time,” Raul replied. 
			“Well, I had a great time with you and would love to see you again.. when are you free?” 
			“Aw hmm… You know I have a lot going on the next two weeks, but let’s keep in touch.” 
			It wasn’t that Raul lacked interest in her, it was just that he had much bigger things on his mind at the moment, and he Understood there was no rush. He would let the woman’s imagination and time preheat the oven as he attended to his next course of Action in life and on the Mission at hand.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">When Raul got home, he sank into the couch and pulled the brown envelope from his pocket. He unfolded the envelope and placed it on the table in front of him. 
			As he replayed the Magic and adventure of the day, he became curious about so many things. How did the Master know my name? I never even spoke it… and I used a fake name when I signed up? Where was Master from? How many able Pimps were out there?…  He even wondered what the fake legal documents detailing his ‘crimes of Pimping’ might look like, and how clever the Master’s final Test was. He thought about framing the document and posting it in his bedroom as a constant reminder of The Path. 
			Raul tore the envelope and reached inside. He pulled out a folded sheet of paper and read aloud to himself:</p>
