                <p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">Raul, the Eternal Simp, leaned over the ledge of his third-floor balcony. He was half-drunk and fully spent: spent for the night, for life—all of it. Raul knew the leap from twenty-five feet up wouldn’t be enough to kill him dead; he did, however, have a brief fantasy of his life as a paraplegic and the potential beauty it would entail. He envisioned a wild and passionate romance with his caretaker: a young, illiterate Hispanic nurse. She would tend to his wounds and in soft, broken English whisper her admirations in his ear. He had received a Purple Heart after all, for demonstrating unwavering bravery and perseverance as a prisoner of war, held captive for twenty years by pathological women and shrapnel-spewing whores… Raul’s first and second wives had cheated on him with other low-level service employees. His third, Isabel, left in the night never to be seen or heard from again. His fourth, he caught red-handed fucking Richard Pew, a 73-year-old bisexual and regionally famous magician. 
			What decent man deserved this horrific fate? What past life karma could possibly spawn such relentless calamity? How is it that other men have such good goddamn fortune? Like the lemon he was, Raul slunk away from the railing, retreated to his bedroom, masturbated for twelve minutes, and fell asleep, hoping tomorrow was the day his fate would turn.
     		 The next morning, the sky was a deep purple. Raul awoke to the crackle of heavy rain. He began his morning routine: he trimmed his whiskers, ironed his janitorial coveralls, ate a lightly toasted bagel with store-brand jam, and retrieved the mail from his letterbox. As Raul shuffled through a swarm of bills and tomfoolery, his eye was caught by a fluorescent blue envelope. Something about its hue felt menacing and hypnotic— enchanting, but not to be trusted. He was in no mood for another one of life’s grifts. 
			Raul set the envelope aside with all the other junk mail and continued to sift through the pile but the strange blue screamed and hissed in the corner of his eye. Ignore its allure Raul! There is nothing but trouble in there! But… what fortune may be held within, Raul? Oh get real, Raul! It’s probably the crafty little Asian children from floor two trying to recruit you for another grueling summer of trumpet lessons! 
			As the war raged in his head—his hands—apparently oblivious to the chaos, tore the envelope open. With one eye cracked, he reached in and swiftly yanked out a small notecard with five italicized serif words ‘The Master Returns to America.’ Raul’s mouth fell open. The notecard quivered violently in his hand, its words blurring in and out of focus as a rolling thunder shook the room.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“We are gathered here today to solve a riddle as old as time. You can thank Adam— for when he first slid his crooked finger into the soft, warm slit of Eve, he set in motion the Eternal Conundrum of Man and a millennia of madness.. You have ensnared yourself in the Trap of all traps, and yet you have no idea of your own captivity. You came today with childish questions of pussy-piping and pick up lines, and it’s my lone hope that when you leave today, you will leave with something else entirely… And it will not be answer you came looking for. In fact, it will be a question.. The One Real Question… Neither I, nor Saint Peter himself has the answer for you. For it was you, and only you that created this mess, and it is you and only you who has the power to see your way out of it…” 
			A middle aged Pakistani man with a pitiful mustache raised his hand. Before being addressed, and with his hand still raised awkwardly, he rose and spoke in a thick Indian accent.
			“But sir, I did not pay to hear philosophical musings. I was told you could teach me how to fuck on college girls and find a good wife.”
			“Fuck on college girls you may Kapul, find a wife you may… but if and only if you come to Understand the Truth… women, dating, fucking… these are a symptom, a mere by-product of Pimping. They are not the Mission. They are the ice cold cups of Gatorade waiting for you at the pit-stops on the marathon of life… on the real Mission at hand… If it is only sex with beautiful women you desire Kapul, then find the Master of Commerce, take a seminar, make yourself a small fortune, and go to a whore house… but I challenge you to ask yourself after the first load you spew, if that was ‘It,’ if that pop was the truest desire of your heart. For the True Desire of man never falters or retreats. It is always there, calling…”
			“But what could possibly be better than some good snatch Master?!” interjected the Indian man. The other men agreed. 
			“You are a mouse in a closet looking for cheese. A mouse with no awareness to the vastness of the house you live in. A mouse that could never even fathom a journey to the other side of the neighborhood. A mouse that could never understand the fact that the neighborhood is but a mouse to the city, the city a mouse to the nation, and the nation a mouse to Earth. Are you such a fool that you spent 4,000 dollars and flew from India to learn of the cheese in the closet? Lower your arm. Sit down.”
			“Sir… I was born in Georgia,” muttered the Pakistani man.
			“I enjoy cheese. Greatly, sir. My uncle owns a pizza parlor in Brooklyn. So you will teach us nothing of women? Please teach us of women, Master,” interjected a man who wanted to Believe.
			“I will teach you about women and the simple form of pimping as you know it to be, as conquering The Woman is the central battle in all of your narratives, and the greatest hurdle to your evolution. Her and her sweet titties and her sharp tongue, they are the center of your Universe. She sends fear up your spine, and electricity through your little dick. She makes your voice shake, and your knees weak. She takes one look at another man, and crushes your fragile soul. She must be conquered…”
			The men perked up, ready to receive and savor every word of esoteric wisdom the Master had in store.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">The Master took a deep breath and the fire returned to his voice.
			“Do you see Her now? Do you Understand the Reality of the creature that once made you tremble in fear? How could this creature ever Hurt you? What could she ever Take from you? Sear this image in your mind, picture it day and night, let it be the first thing you see in the morning, the last thing you see at night.. let it paint the skies of every dream you dream... and in time, the software of your mind that deals with women will take on a new shape, a new perception… one that is more in line with Reality… one that can immerse itself in a new Language… and as the script of this software is rewritten, the other softwares of the Mind too become more malleable, more unsure of themselves, and easier to adjust or destroy. This process is a key aspect of the evolution from man to Pimp… Now repeat after me: She is not the enemy. She is just like me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Exactly twenty two minutes later the Master reemerged onto the stage. This time doing a little sashay to the center. He sat back down in lotus position, rubbed his hands together and spoke with a mischievous grin. 
			“The Master takes his medicine, and relieves himself and twenty men disappear? Tsk Tsk.. It is not their time. And it may not be yours either, but know that just by still being seated, Here... in this moment... there is something Alive and Aware in you. For you are learning to see through the simple deceptions and tests of the world, and you are operating with stillness and patience. It is these characteristics that make the Pimp so smooth, so crafty, so capable...” 
			“Master speak more to of us of stillness and patience,” said Raul.
			“Stillness, patience.. these are qualities of a man moving beyond the Mechanical Mind who realizes in the physical sense, there is nowhere Here to go.. no reason to race past the cars on the street only to sit next to them at the red light a mile ahead. Now let’s speak on these qualities in regard to your relations with the woman. The average man receives a message from a woman he is conversing with, and what does he do? First, he thinks to himself ‘I have seen enough YouTube videos to know I must wait a bit before I respond, as I would not want to come across as needy.’ Six minutes in and the Fear starts to knock at his chest, ‘but if I wait any longer, maybe another man may snatch her attention.’ Approximately eight minutes after receiving her message, he responds with some half-witted tease that has no Magic or direction, for he has no idea where he is even taking this woman. The slightly stronger man, he responds in seventeen minutes. His message has a semblance of direction and Magic, and is just enough to warrant another casual response as she continues to test the water with the most base level of curiosity and bask in the validation of his attention. But what about the Pimp? Where is the Pimp in all of this and what the hell is he up to?”
			“He’s going to pound town on the triplets he met at the Walgreens! Ain’t he Master?” hooted the pudgy man. 
			The master dismissed the man’s juvenile remark with a wave of his hand.
			“The pimp is busy slaying the real dragon. He doesn’t even see her message until the next day. When he does, he reads it—along with seven other messages from similar women—and begins to scan for the woman that has a high level of interest, and knows how to Dance.. the one who is alive and present, and returns Magic with Magic. But then… there is a ring at the doorbell, so he drops the phone and the women and runs to the door. On his step is a mysterious package.. the one he has been anticipating! So he takes the package and scurries down into his basement... In the corner of the basement is a make-shift laboratory with shelves full of strange chemicals and glass beakers. The man rips open the package, throws on his goggles and shouts, ‘Pfizer said it couldn’t be done! Moderna said it was light years away! But nay! One man discovered the elixir in his basement! The first and only true cure for Swamp Ass is on its way!’ He stays entranced in his chemistry for the next four days straight, and emerges with a smile on his face, for he has made another inch of progress on the thousand mile journey. ‘My my what a victory.. I could really go for a cold gatorade and a recharge!’ he says to himself.”
			The Master arched his head back and simulated big gulps from a bottle. He wiped his head and continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I too stand by the Master.. I too am guilty of pursuing the Path of the Pimp—and I shall pursue it every day until death!” Gregory roared. 
			There was a heart and fullness in his voice, a depth and conviction he, nor anyone else on Earth had ever heard materialize from within him before. 
			The bitch men looked on in astonishment. As they stood on the left side of the room as “free men,” there was a part of all of them that Understood they were witnessing something special Unfolding— something that they couldn’t quite put their finger on, something their Mechanical Minds just couldn’t fully compute. 
			The agents closed in on Raul and Gregory, threw them to the ground violently, and cuffed them.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The Head Fed set down his gun on the table and lit a cigarette ablaze. As he exhaled a waft of smoke, he began to slow clap, and in a cool calm tone, he spoke,
			“Gentlemen… it is with the Master’s blessings I hereby announce you Pimp’s of the First Degree. Congratulations and welcome to The Path.” 
			“Now get these fucking cuffs off us…  Jesus, Buck!.. how many times have I told you not to cuff me so fucking tight.. I’m not as nimble as I used to be... I’m an old ass man!” zipped the Master. 
			“At once, Master! Just making sure you haven’t gone full simp on us! My apologies sir!” the ‘Fed’ replied as he scurried behind the Master to finagle his cuffs.</p>
