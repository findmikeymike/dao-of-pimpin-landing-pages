                <p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Speak to us more of… the… Tests along the way, Master. It seems as if… as if… all of life itself is just one Test… after… another..” said the ginger man with a waver in his voice.
			“As I said before, the Tests of life, of the woman.. they are not the enemy. They are not a force of evil. They are your friend. They are there to aid and propel your evolution. Like everything else we have discussed today, the first step is to recognize and be conscious of the tests. Let’s go back to the woman, as her tests are relentless and a metaphor for all of life tests. The woman’s tests are a constant and endless check on man as to whether he is centered in himself and his Mission. The majority of you are here because you fail the very first test of the woman, and that is having a basic conviction in yourself. Her entire evolution has wired her to smell your bullshit from a mile away, as her evolutionary survival depended on it. You approach her and she senses your fear and incongruence, she senses you have no direction in your step, and her subconscious mind sounds the alarm: ‘He is afraid and shook by a 140-pound girl that wishes him no harm.. what will the world do to him?!’ And she is right!”
			The Master was in the Zone. The pace of his speech picked up as he continued.
			“Now let’s say you have some semblance of conviction and competence and you have begun dating a woman for a few months, and she says to you ‘I think its silly your refrigerator is full of sauces and find it a bit embarrassing to see you going door to door like a peasant trying hustle your sauce. My father said he would give you a real job.’ What does the average man do? He quits, in fear he may lose her... and on the surface she is happy, because here is a man that was so afraid to lose her, he gave up on The Mission. She feels validated in her Womanly Woo and influence, but beneath the surface, deep in her soul she is repulsed, and her attraction withers. The man was swayed from his own Will and Path by an outside opinion and a few unpleasant comments… How many of you have been this man? How many of you are still He?”
			Raul was the first to raise his hand. He had always been this man, oblivious to the glaringly obvious. His newfound clarity on a world once shrouded in mystery and chaos was truly emancipating. 
			The Master signaled for the men to put down their hands as he continued the teaching.
			“Know that she will plunder you with a barrage of trivial tests too, from the ‘I don’t like this song. Change it,’ to the ‘You would never really vote for that man, would you?’ All these can be translated into the same question ‘Are you a Pimp or a bitch? Are you about that life or are you not?’ And the correct answer is always your Truth, your Will, what you Want for Yourself... no matter how offended or disgruntled it may make her on the surface, know that on a deeper level you sticking to your guns and standing where you Choose to stand is what draws her closer and makes her gain trust in you as a man. And as for the true Pimp…”
			The Master smiled a devious smile.
			“The true Pimp who understands all of this knows how to flip the script on her entirely. He is on a date with a woman and starts deploying his own tests and challenges before she even has a chance to set the age old ‘I’m the woman and you are here to impress me… now here’s your first test’ frame. She scrambles as her Mechanical Mind is not used to being in such a peculiar and compromising position. He is tickled to see the true simp come out in her.. ‘No, no!’ she says, ‘I only went to see Maroon 5 because my friend had bought the tickets!’ The pimp chuckles in amusement and pokes at her, ‘Riiiiiight.. Check please!” 
			“Brilliant, sir! But… how on Earth is the woman so damn crafty? How many hours a day does she scheme on the man?” said a spirited young man.
			The Master had a good laugh at this. 
			“No, no… the vast majority of the time, a woman’s test are not consciously concocted. She is not off in some dark alley trading ‘catch the man’ tests with other women… The testing is wired and of an evolutionary nature. It is a survival mechanism of her subconscious mind to weed out the simps and weaklings from the true Pimps... and it is for this reason that her tests are not always easy to recognize... as you will not sense any level of deception or fuckery in the delivery of her tests… but know that until you have proved unwavering conviction in yourself and your Path, her tests, and the world’s tests, will not cease. Again, we must not see this is a burden, but a gift and service to keep you on your toes and steadfast on the Mission. Know that just like the undertaking of the Mission, we are not out to pass a woman’s tests to keep the woman or please the woman, we pass these tests for ourselves, for our own evolution. Her attraction is just a symptom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The Master stood and began to walk elegantly from one side of the stage to the other as he spoke.
			“Right now in this very moment there are millions of men all over the world shouting ‘that fucking savage bitch! How could she?!’ Oh the chumps, if they had any Understanding of Reality, they would be thanking the woman for leaving, as there are two main ways a woman exits a man’s life against his wishings, and both are a gift to the man. The first way is if the woman was no good, and did something unforgivable… She blew his cousin or lied about her entire past… in which case he thanks her for taking out the trash and freeing him from her depravity. The second way, the more tragic of the two, is when she leaves because the man is weak or has moved into his feminine and her attraction disintegrates to nothingness… and begrudgingly, he must thank her for shining a light on this weakness and the chinks in his armor. For the pain inflicted by her exit serves as a baptism by fire and inspires a growth in him. This is how the Aware man deals with these scenarios. Unfortunately, for the majority of men, still anchored in their Mechanical Minds, they blame her and the world and fall further into the abyss of impotence and lifelessness. It is for this reason that the average disgruntled man sees the woman as the enemy, as his adversary. He has no awareness that her role in his narrative is to aid the blossoming of the true Power in him, by any means necessary. He makes getting the woman and keeping her his mission, he becomes reactive and emotional, he moves fully into his Feminine, and this repels her.” 
			The Master stopped his pacing and turned to the men. He stared straight out at them and spoke earnestly.
			“The truth is that a woman does not want to be man’s Mission, she does not want to be the center of his universe, or the reason he gets out of bed in the morning... She may say it is so, but Understand, it is never, ever so.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>
