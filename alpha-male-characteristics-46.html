                <p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, I once heard a man I presumed wise say that ‘she is never your girl, it’s just your turn.’ That a female is always looking for the better deal? Is this so? Is there hope for a man who does not need a harem and would like to find a woman to spend his life with?” 
			“Due to the impermanence of most relationships—not just those with the woman, you could say there’s some Truth to that... but the idea that all women are just slaves to their genetic imperatives—constantly on the hunt for a higher-status man ignores that there is more to a woman… and more to humanity, than just evolution and chemistry. The Deep Web Overlords who preach this fail to see the bigger picture: that the soul of a being has been on a long journey, each at different levels of refinement and Awareness. Ask the same man who said, ‘all woman are the same and will surely betray you’ about Mother Theresa and he will tell you she did not go around the world to feed the needy, she went around the world to try a cock from every nation! The truth of the matter is that the majority of humans in the present era, women and men alike, do not stick to any strict moral or ethical code and have been conditioned to look out for Themselves and do whatever feels good. So yes, you will meet many base women, many scoundrels, many undercover hookers, just as the decent women out there will meet many pathetic, limp men. Both sexes are a victim to the lies of the Shadow, and there distrust of each other so deep, entire movements and groups have formed... the Feminists, the Red Pillers... each using the other as a scapegoat for their own confusion. With such chaos in the modern age, is it possible to find a good woman to spend your life with? To that I say, I do believe it is possible for two souls on a similar frequency, with a certain sense of maturity and clarity, to live consciously and enjoy a life together. If it is your Will and Desire to meet a good-hearted, honest woman to spend the rest of your days with, then let it be so… romance it up, Dance with no fear. But know this—even if a man has the desire to spend his life with someone, he should be equipped to carry on the Mission and the Journey if the deeper power within him or the Almighty Pimp has other plans. For life is fleeting, love is fleeting, the world is fleeting, always, into the Great Abyss…”
			“Master, that was somehow… painfully hopeful and beautifully excruciating,” Gregory chirped.
			“Isn’t that the nature of life, Gregory? What Magic would there be—what Ride—if not for the Love and the Fear, the pain and the beauty, the symmetry and the chaos… That’s why we emphasize fluidity… and being like the River… Man must Understand everything just Is… You come with nothing, you leave with nothing. That.. is True Freedom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Truthfully Lou… I have had a very long day but maybe another time,” Raul replied. 
			“Well, I had a great time with you and would love to see you again.. when are you free?” 
			“Aw hmm… You know I have a lot going on the next two weeks, but let’s keep in touch.” 
			It wasn’t that Raul lacked interest in her, it was just that he had much bigger things on his mind at the moment, and he Understood there was no rush. He would let the woman’s imagination and time preheat the oven as he attended to his next course of Action in life and on the Mission at hand.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">Raul the Pimp, 		Let the contents of this envelope serve you on 
	The Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>
