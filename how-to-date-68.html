                <p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, exactly… because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails—she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers—the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap… their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.”
			The Master paused for a beat.
			“Are we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?”
			The flock nodded. 
			The Master continued.
			“Twenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, “Come, it’s time you show me how to dance.” Notice the way this man Moves—fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature—vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure—and the ‘proving’—on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old ‘man impresses woman’ adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.”
			The Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.
			"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist—no hesitation, no fear—and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor… alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it… for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself—whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who’s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. ‘Take me, you wild stallion,’ she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye… the soft glow of her skin… ‘It is time,’ he says to himself. So the man—’’
			A lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically— 
			“Sir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I’m sure you understand Master!” 
			The Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. 
			“Which one of these men next to you is erect?” howled The Master.
			“It is I, Master.” murmured a soft voice. 
			The man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,
			“If any consolation, sir… gentleman… I don’t believe it is a gay erection… it is just that Master’s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual… he captured my emotions and I apologize,” he said softly.
			The Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. 
			“Apologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here… Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings… we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or… purely mechanical,” the Master said calmly. 
			The Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. 
			“You may move your seat... six inches closer to him.” 
			“Sir?” gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. 
			“You heard me… his little erection is not going to harm you… you said where you’re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,” quipped the Master. 
			“Sir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!” said the man, now on the verge of tears.
 			“Then leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!” 
			The Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.
			“Let us proceed… where did we leave off?” said the Master. 
			“Master, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels… dare I say… sinister… or Machiavellian,” a man replied.
			“What you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself… do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man… You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.”
			“But Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?” objected the man.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">"Now we have begun to explore a very important question. How does one start? Where can he begin in the real world? And I will tell you, with everything said here today, if you approach a woman with this knowledge, in the moment, nothing will change. Your hands will still shake, your armpits will run.. Because the Mechanical Mind is your master, and it hasn’t changed a bit. You cannot reason with the Mechanical Mind, you cannot arm it with a few nifty knowings and expect it to change a thirty year course. The Mechanical Mind cannot be moved as the Fear will still be there guarding the kingdom. The mind, the fear, they cannot be shaken or coaxed from their position. They must be nuked, obliterated! And so to annihilate the fear, first we must look directly at the fear, and understand the fear. Where it came from. How it came to be…”
			The Master scanned the room to make sure the men were still with him. They were.
			“The Fear was birthed from the womb of The Lie— back when you were but a shrimp. Your mother started to tell you, ‘If you want girls to like you, you need to brush your hair.’ You watched the television show of the bumbling man and saw him burn his first date to the ground, cursing himself the whole way home. You watched your older brother retreat to his bedroom and hibernate in agony after his first girlfriend gave him the shaft. You were bombarded with advertisements selling you products that would make you more enticing to her eye. All these things convincing you that your life’s purpose was to appeal to and appease the woman, to bow beneath her throne like a measly pauper and beg for a whiff of her pure and perfect feet. And as each day passed, your young, impressionable mind began to spin a web. Every mishap with a woman, every wrong word, every heartbreak, another fly caught in the web, never to die, only to squirm and gnaw at you as you carried on your journey. And every time you went to open your mouth in the presence of a woman, the little flies screamed and shrieked in unison ‘Not another fly! There is no room in this web! Please, spin a new web! Choose another battle!’ The Fear kicked in, and any chance at presence, clarity, Magic—eliminated. This is the root and flowering of the Fear. This is the web that must be cut from the mind.”
			Raul closed his eyes and scanned the webs woven across his mind. He saw each of his ex-wives, with eight limbs, skittering frantically from one side of his skull to the other, whispering covertly to each other as their paths crossed. He heard their taunts and laughter rippling through the canyons of his Being. He had a vision from the past, and remembered the look on his father’s face the muggy summer night his mother left with another man. He was eleven years old, and for sixth months straight, Raul slept next to his father, in fear the man may reach for the pistol under his bed and off himself in the night. 
			“So let us start the process of cutting… and we start with a Truth, the flies are phantom. They are an imagining, an echo of a non-real past. And the women and experiences that gave way to the flies, they were not what you thought, your perceptions of the Real distorted by The Lie. You looked upon her as if she was ‘It,’ the center of the Universe, the Mission, the Light and the Way. But what is she truly? A lost creature on a strange planet, on a journey in search of something More... just like you, just as fearful as you, just as insecure as you. Yes even the most beautiful woman... what does she see in the mirror?”
			The congregation hadn’t a clue what went through the mind of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Master... I… I don’t kn—“
			“Shush! You will or you won’t, Gregory. Know that in the grandest sense of it all, this is the One Real Question, the one real choice for man: Action or death. There is no halfway, no low-level pimp... One either takes Action and dives head first into the abyss or he submits to being another cog in the machine, another Mechanical Mind humming along through the scenes of life, pretending to be alive… At the heart of this all, at the core of everything said here today, understand that it is the Pimp who chooses Life, he who answers the Call with Action. You thought the Pimp was he who fucks women… I am telling you— it is the Pimp who fucks the shit out of life.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“Speak to us more of… the… Tests along the way, Master. It seems as if… as if… all of life itself is just one Test… after… another..” said the ginger man with a waver in his voice.
			“As I said before, the Tests of life, of the woman.. they are not the enemy. They are not a force of evil. They are your friend. They are there to aid and propel your evolution. Like everything else we have discussed today, the first step is to recognize and be conscious of the tests. Let’s go back to the woman, as her tests are relentless and a metaphor for all of life tests. The woman’s tests are a constant and endless check on man as to whether he is centered in himself and his Mission. The majority of you are here because you fail the very first test of the woman, and that is having a basic conviction in yourself. Her entire evolution has wired her to smell your bullshit from a mile away, as her evolutionary survival depended on it. You approach her and she senses your fear and incongruence, she senses you have no direction in your step, and her subconscious mind sounds the alarm: ‘He is afraid and shook by a 140-pound girl that wishes him no harm.. what will the world do to him?!’ And she is right!”
			The Master was in the Zone. The pace of his speech picked up as he continued.
			“Now let’s say you have some semblance of conviction and competence and you have begun dating a woman for a few months, and she says to you ‘I think its silly your refrigerator is full of sauces and find it a bit embarrassing to see you going door to door like a peasant trying hustle your sauce. My father said he would give you a real job.’ What does the average man do? He quits, in fear he may lose her... and on the surface she is happy, because here is a man that was so afraid to lose her, he gave up on The Mission. She feels validated in her Womanly Woo and influence, but beneath the surface, deep in her soul she is repulsed, and her attraction withers. The man was swayed from his own Will and Path by an outside opinion and a few unpleasant comments… How many of you have been this man? How many of you are still He?”
			Raul was the first to raise his hand. He had always been this man, oblivious to the glaringly obvious. His newfound clarity on a world once shrouded in mystery and chaos was truly emancipating. 
			The Master signaled for the men to put down their hands as he continued the teaching.
			“Know that she will plunder you with a barrage of trivial tests too, from the ‘I don’t like this song. Change it,’ to the ‘You would never really vote for that man, would you?’ All these can be translated into the same question ‘Are you a Pimp or a bitch? Are you about that life or are you not?’ And the correct answer is always your Truth, your Will, what you Want for Yourself... no matter how offended or disgruntled it may make her on the surface, know that on a deeper level you sticking to your guns and standing where you Choose to stand is what draws her closer and makes her gain trust in you as a man. And as for the true Pimp…”
			The Master smiled a devious smile.
			“The true Pimp who understands all of this knows how to flip the script on her entirely. He is on a date with a woman and starts deploying his own tests and challenges before she even has a chance to set the age old ‘I’m the woman and you are here to impress me… now here’s your first test’ frame. She scrambles as her Mechanical Mind is not used to being in such a peculiar and compromising position. He is tickled to see the true simp come out in her.. ‘No, no!’ she says, ‘I only went to see Maroon 5 because my friend had bought the tickets!’ The pimp chuckles in amusement and pokes at her, ‘Riiiiiight.. Check please!” 
			“Brilliant, sir! But… how on Earth is the woman so damn crafty? How many hours a day does she scheme on the man?” said a spirited young man.
			The Master had a good laugh at this. 
			“No, no… the vast majority of the time, a woman’s test are not consciously concocted. She is not off in some dark alley trading ‘catch the man’ tests with other women… The testing is wired and of an evolutionary nature. It is a survival mechanism of her subconscious mind to weed out the simps and weaklings from the true Pimps... and it is for this reason that her tests are not always easy to recognize... as you will not sense any level of deception or fuckery in the delivery of her tests… but know that until you have proved unwavering conviction in yourself and your Path, her tests, and the world’s tests, will not cease. Again, we must not see this is a burden, but a gift and service to keep you on your toes and steadfast on the Mission. Know that just like the undertaking of the Mission, we are not out to pass a woman’s tests to keep the woman or please the woman, we pass these tests for ourselves, for our own evolution. Her attraction is just a symptom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">The Head Fed set down his gun on the table and lit a cigarette ablaze. As he exhaled a waft of smoke, he began to slow clap, and in a cool calm tone, he spoke,
			“Gentlemen… it is with the Master’s blessings I hereby announce you Pimp’s of the First Degree. Congratulations and welcome to The Path.” 
			“Now get these fucking cuffs off us…  Jesus, Buck!.. how many times have I told you not to cuff me so fucking tight.. I’m not as nimble as I used to be... I’m an old ass man!” zipped the Master. 
			“At once, Master! Just making sure you haven’t gone full simp on us! My apologies sir!” the ‘Fed’ replied as he scurried behind the Master to finagle his cuffs.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory entered the Tavern with an energy and ease they had never stepped into anywhere before…. like two young warriors who had just put their lives on the line for the first time and claimed victory in a fierce battle. Only an hour ago they’d been staring down a life behind bars... what was there to fear? Who or what could possibly Move them after a day like today? 
			As they approached the bar, a young hottie with tattoos grabbed Gregory’s arm. 
			“Hey daddy… how about a beer for the pretty lady? Hm? Buy me a beer?” yapped the hottie with an air of entitlement and expectation. 
			“Would you like my ATM number too?” Gregory replied in a calm, careless tone. 
			The girl was a bit taken aback. It was not what she expected to hear come out of this small Indian man’s mouth. 
			“Well, if you give me your ATM number, I could take you to get a haircut and maybe even get that dirty little mustache shaved off,” she challenged.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“If we cut all my hair off, what will you have to run your hands through tomorrow morning?” Gregory replied with a sly charm. 
			Raul looked on with great joy and amusement. The tatted hottie’s cheeks flushed florescent pink, and though she was emotionally aroused and intrigued by such boldness and wit from the most unexpected of men, she could not keep up with his Dance, and defaulted to a front of offense. 
			“Wow… you really just said that?” she muttered dully. 
			“You heard daddy, and unless you want his named tattooed on the low of your back, I suggest you play nice with him. How about you use that womanly wile of yours and go snatch all three of us a drink. That should be no challenge for a girl like you. We’ll wait here,” Raul poked coyly. 
			“Oh, me go get the drinks? You two are quite the duo… the chivalry!” She shook her head, half-frazzled, half-bemused, and retreated to her friend. 
			Her friend was watching the encounter, appraising the men with her own growing curiosity. Who were they? Why were they so cool and unaffected? How many hearts must they have conquered to gain such wit and indifference? 
			Raul slung his arm around Gregory’s shoulder and they turned towards the bar—completely unfazed by the women’s exit. 
			“Two whiskeys, hard and straight, mam,” Gregory said to the bartender. 
			The bartender poured heavy glasses and slid them across the bar. Raul and Gregory grabbed their drinks and clinked them. 
			“To the Path. To the Master. To the Mission. To fucking the shit out of this strange, beautiful life...” exclaimed Raul.</p>
