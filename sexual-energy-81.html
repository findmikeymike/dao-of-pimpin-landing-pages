                <p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">Somewhere in southern Florida at 4 A.M., Raul sat in a gigantic, windowless auditorium with 1,253 other broken and helpless men. The auditorium was cold and archaic, giving the impression it hadn’t seen a lick of activity in the last twenty years. The air in the room smelled like vinegar and mildew. The floor was stained a tainted shade of yellow. The room sizzled with nervous whisperings and squeaking chairs.
			It was nearly lunch hour, and a good portion of the men had lost all faith and left in a tizzy. “What kind of goddamn master books a shit-hole like this and shows up hours late!” they thought to themselves as they skidded out of the parking lot. As for the remaining men, they clung to the last tethers of hope, and as their hope withered and the ache of abandonment began to scream in their intestines—the lights went out in the auditorium… It was pitch fucking black. The whispering seized, and a piercing silence fell on the room. The men’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a few of them noticed something moving in their periphery… and then all of them noticed… a shadowy figure limped slowly towards the center of the stage.
			A circular, almost cartoonish spotlight clicked on and standing as still as a statue in the dead center of the light was a short, crinkled black man with a round gut. The gut hung lazily over his flowing, black velvet pants. What was left of his hair was frazzled and greying. He appeared to be in his mid-70s. His eyes scanned the room, his body remained motionless.
			Soft whisperings surfaced from the silence as the men appraised the static, velvet creature. “Surely this cannot be the master?! Where is our young, toned pussy slayer?! Where is He with a cock like thunder and the triceps of a mule?” a doubter whispered.					“What a disaster his jawline! What a ruse his vitality!” another chimed in. 
			Then, like an eruption, deep bellowing laughter surged through the speakers, echoing through the auditorium. When the last trail of the Velvet Man's laughter faded, there were exactly three seconds of a deadly hush, and then, with a deep and slow Southern draw, The Master spoke… 
			“You fucking cunts, look at you all… traveling from the edges of Earth, shelling the last of your humble earnings for a chance at a little pussy. You have been scammed yet again. But take solace in knowing you have helped me greatly. My debts are paid, and my future secure. I will not waste one penny of your hard earned money. I shall spend the rest of my days traveling to exotic islands, drinking the strongest liquors, and bedding the most beautiful harlots this world has ever birthed. I appreciate every one of you. You may go now.” 
			A scrawny man with a bowl cut took to his feet.
			“How dare you! How dare you swindle us in the hour of our greatest desperation! Burn in hell you old bandit!” he screeched. His body shook like an old motor on its last mile. A tear rolled down his face. The Master wailed in amusement. 
			“God strike this old devil with Syphilis and Scabies! Make him pay! Make his last days hellfire!” howled another naysayer.
			The Master clapped joyfully along to the men’s ranting and then, in a cool and calm voice replied, 
			“Yes, yes. That’s the spirit. The Good Lord has heard your request and added it to his To-Do list. You, too, are dismissed.” 
			Raul watched as the dejected men rose to their feet, steaming and screaming as they cast their stones at the stage. He wondered for which of these men it was the final straw, the last faint glimmer of hope being  devoured by the all-consuming darkness. Surely tomorrow there would be the news: “Heartbroken Simpleton, 31, found dead in a river.” Who would be the first to take that great leap? 
			One by one, the men shuffled towards the exit, cursing under their breath at themselves and the world. Raul continued to watch the men without moving. He was nine hundred miles from home with nowhere to go, nothing left to lose. His rage was exhausted. He had no will to stand, or leave, and so, he sat.  
			Within a few short moments, a room of over a thousand men had withered to thirty seven. The Master took off his shoes, sat down on the floor in the lotus position, tapped the microphone twice, and said, 
			“Now let us begin.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Let us start at the beginning: You simps open your mouth to speak to a woman, and she is not moved. Hell, she’s usually appalled. She looks into your eyes and the fiery goddess deep within her subconscious immediately recognizes: this man does not Understand. This man does not know The Way. He is weak and confused, fearful and timid, he has no true life-force, no Presence or Awareness of this Great Unfolding and his journey will be no Ride… You hit her with your crafty lines and your bad boy smirk you practiced in the mirror for twelve hours, and little do you know, you have made the original mistake. You spoke to her in a language she does not speak. Your words have fallen on deaf ears.” 
			The Master raised his voice.
			“The true language of a woman makes not a sound. The true language and currency with a woman—and all humans for that matter—is Emotion. It is Feeling… And while there are many shades of emotion, many hues, there are only two true and primal emotions: Love and Fear. It is love and fear that cause the indescribable thump in her chest, the sweat in her palms. The little league player knows how to make her feel loved, the division one player knows how to deal her a bit of fear and anxiety, but the Pimp knows that it is neither love nor fear that truly fills the deepest yearnings of a woman’s soul.”
			The Master leaned forward and paused for a beat. He spoke slowly, with great intention. 
			“It is The Ride… the ride from love to fear, from fear to love, that ignite her bones and dampen her labias. It is in the Movement between these internal worlds that the power lies. It is The Ride that awakens her being, and reminds her that she is Here, Now… that something is Happening—and that she’s a part of it. It is The Ride, the exhilarating emotional journey, that she truly yearns, that she seeks.”
			The Master eased back into his default posture.
			“So when we talk about engaging with a woman, connecting with a woman, attracting a woman, banging the shit out of a woman, this is the language we are speaking, the language of Feeling. It is the cinder and soot the castle is built upon.”
			A skeptical man with slicked back hair, a gaudy satin shirt, and dark eyes snickered. He made sure his mockery of the Master was loud enough for all to hear.
			“Ha! Our words do not matter? A man can say ‘anything?’ A solid pick-up line cannot capture a woman?! Gimme a break!” scoffed the skeptical man with dark eyes.
			“My brooding Casanova, have these pre-rehearsed lines ever worked for you?” the Master snapped back.
			“My ‘name’ is Judas Finkleberry, and yes, in fact they do work. I have spent time with a ‘True’ Master, one who has given me a sequence of Words that can have even the most strident feminist butt-fucking-naked and begging for it in twenty minutes flat,” sneered the cynical Judas. 
			There were audible gasps from the men. The Master was tickled.
			“Oh is that so, Mr. Finklebobby? And I gather that is why you are here with us today? Because your incantations and spells are so potent with the woman?” replied the Master calmly.
			“Four words is all it takes…” said Judas with a scowl.
			“Get in my Ferrari!” jested the Master.
			The congregation of men snickered. Raul looked to Judas and sensed a heavy, metallic vibe about the man, as if he had been hurt by the world, and vowed to return the hurt by any means necessary. The Master turned his attention back to the believers. 
			“Let us proceed. And if The Dao proves false, we’ll all pitch in and pay our dear Judas for the real Magic. Deal?”
			The collective of men nodded in agreement.
			“What I am saying is that your words are only as useful as the Feelings they carry, a shell to transmit the real Language and Magic. The weight they hold is but a fart in the wind in comparison to the energy and emotion you create simply from your Presence. I am telling you that you can say damn near anything to a woman, yes damn near anything, and if You and your essence are in the right space, holding a certain Presence and ease, it will Move a woman far more than Mr. Finklebottom and his four sacred words. I’m saying that the energy and sound of your voice alone carry far more weight than the words that fall from the tongue.”
			The misanthropic Judas shook his head and looked at the Master with venom in his beady eyes. The Master paid no mind to his hostility and continued.
			“You are always asking what to say to a woman, and I’m telling you it is the wrong question. The reason you and ninety seven percent of men struggle so much with women is because you are eternally missing the forest for the trees. You are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. You have been walking around for damn near your entire life like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to figure out the mysteries of the woman, and every where you turn, someone else equally as confused is there to point you in the wrong direction.”
			“But Master how does one learn to speak this sacred language?” said a zealous man. 
			“How does one learn how to do anything? He studies very closely the one who does. You have seen men all your life who had that magic touch with women, but you were watching for all the wrong things. You assumed it must have been his classic smile or the tangerine scent of his cologne… I’m telling you to not just watch the man, but Feel him.. feel his jive, his ease, the rhythm he speaks at, the color he uses to describe the world around him.. I’m telling you to watch yourself, and your own emotions.”
			The Master stood up and began to pace the stage smoothly and slowly.
			“Imagine for a moment, you are speaking with a woman that by some strange glitch in the matrix does take interest in you, and you are going back and forth in swift digital conversation, and you are sure you’ve it in the bag, already picked out the fresh denim you are going to wear when you meet her, and the first surface in the house where you plan to make love to her, and then all sudden THWAP… crickets… She’s gone. Missing in action. Nowhere on the face of the mother fucking Earth to be found… What is it you feel? You feel the Fear. You fear you must have said something wrong, you fear your last line was not clever enough. You fear she met someone that was More than you… You were in the space of love, and excitement, and anticipation… and now in the blink of your god damn eye, all of that is gone, and all that’s left is fear. She has taken you for The Ride, and like a flaming bag of shit on the doorstep of your poor soul… you can’t look away. You can’t stop thinking about it. It gnaws at you and ignites something in you. You feel anger at yourself for another botch. And then out of no where, the bitch is back! She has risen like Christ! And she tells you she was just ‘caught up with some things and that her aunt had surgery’ and asks you ‘How are you’, and what do you feel? You feel the love again! You feel relieved it was not some idiotic thing you said. You feel excited you might still get to do some fuckin.. maybe even fall in love.. But then… as you obsessively re-read your conversation to get reacquainted with the dynamic and where you left off, you notice those three god forsaken little words: “How. Are. You.” and you start to get a funny feeling in your stomach. How am I? How - am - I? What happened to the heat and the romance? I address the goddamn Postman with more passion than that… The woman went from paragraphs of nonsense and emojicons, to those three lifeless little words… And now all the sudden, it’s the blink of an eye later, and she’s given you the the Pimp Special.. she’s taken you on the Round Trip… You felt the warm tingles of bliss running up your spine and in a single instant, kapoof—the tingles were gone, and you were riding the lightening 2,000 miles per hour straight back to the land of Fear…”
			The Master’s pace picked up speed as he continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Now let us face the beast: Fear… There is natural fear, the healthy fear that was programmed into the hardware of your mind at birth to keep you alive... this  fear is not the problem. The problem lies in the conditioned fear and aversions, the ones you have gathered along the journey that are irrational, and serve you in no way. The majority of these fears are of a social nature, and have to do with your acceptance in the tribe. There was a time when these fears served a purpose for man, as being cast out of the tribe meant certain death in the wild, but both man and the world alike have evolved. A man can survive and thrive on his own without the approval of the family, friends, and society around him. In many ways, his willingness to leave ‘The Group' is the beginning of his journey to his highest self, the true Pimp in him. Look at the life of any Christ or Buddha or great rockstar and you will see… they did not walk in line with society, they vowed for no man or woman’s approval… the Magic of their lives and stories was in opposition to these things.”
 			“Master, tell us more of dealing with these fears and entanglements,” exclaimed Gregory. 
			“First, we understand the difference between fear and aversion. Both must be conquered on the path to Pimpdom. The fear is what makes your heart race and hands shake. Aversions are the things that make you less comfortable in life and bring an unpleasantness to your mind. To unwrite these softwares of fear and aversion you have installed in the Mind, we first be conscious of them. For each of you has had different experiences and spun different webs… different Imprints… and accordingly, there will be different paths to their undoing. Let’s start with you, snacker with the lisp, tell me something that makes your skin crawl, something that strikes no fear in you, but you avoid like the plague.”
			“I hate being wet in clothing, sir. Especially jeans… I do not leave the house when it’s raining past a drizzle.” 
			“Well good gracious, imagine that… a grown man refusing to be involved with life and the world because he does not want to get a little wet. How much Magic and opportunity he may have missed lingering just beyond the rain… It was the Log Flume I presume?” 
			“Good god, Master? How—how could you have known? Yes, it was indeed the Log Flume. I remember being ten years old at the waterpark and the woman guaranteeing me if I sat in the back I would not take on any water… at worst a light mist. I was soaked to the bone and my breasts and rolls protruded from my t-shirt and the other children called me the Flume Whale for nearly a year!” 
			“And as the pain and embarrassment of such an archetypal scene was branded with a hot iron into the Mind, the Web began to spin… the fear left a trail… a present day aversion… and a very silly thing that holds you back in life. It will only continue to hinder you so we must destroy it at once! I want you to put on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt every single day for the next month and have your neighbor dowse you with a hose before you leave your house. I mean drenched and dripping to the damn bone. When you are soaked to the bone, I want you to verbally say aloud, ‘Out with all remnants and noise of the past, for they are but a dream. I am baptized in these waters and made clean again.’ Then go about your business as usual... The first few days you will think of nothing but your discomfort, but with each passing day, you will become used to it. Your mind will accept that you are wet and surrender its useless fight... and day by day the imprint in your mind will begin to evaporate, hell you may even begin to enjoy the cool sensation it brings and how alert you have become. You may start enjoying it so goddamn much you have to pay your neighbor a monthly salary to hose you down in your clothes everyday...” 
			“Master I have no relation with my neighbors.” 
			“Then it will be one hell of an ice breaker... ‘Hello my good man, would you mind spraying me with your fucking hose?’ What sane man could refuse such good fun?”
			“But Master if—”
			The pudgy man tried to interject but was steamrolled by the impassioned Master.
			“After you have completed this torrential month, I want you to repeat the process, but this time, I want you out in the world shirtless. Let those titties swing and that belly shake. For we must get to the root of this web, right down to the fear that birthed it.”
			The pudgy man with the lisp opened his mouth to respond but the Master pressed on.
			“Now let us move on to someone else. You there... little ginger man with the large nose, hiding his head… yes, you… what is that haunts your dreams?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Sheesh, we’re going a little over my pay grade here,” joked one of the men.
			“I think some part of you already gets it,” said the Master, with a knowing smile.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">The metal chairs screeched in agony as the men pushed them aside and dove to the floor. 	Raul’s head hit the musky floor, inches from Gregory’s. He couldn’t help but notice the thousand microscopic beads of sweat sliding down Gregory’s mini mustache. 
			“Do you think… think this may be… a test, brother?” Gregory whispered as soft as a mouse. 
			“A test! Did you see the Fear in Master’s eyes? These are Federal Agents, Gregory! This is no theatre,” Raul hissed back. 
			Gregory squeezed his eyes shut and began to pant. The armed men had surrounded them now, their rifles aimed to kill. 
			There were six armed men on stage surrounding the Master. Two of the men grabbed the Master’s arms from behind with violent force, slamming cuffs on his wrists. The Master wailed in agony.  The leader of the Fed team knelt down in front of the Master and snarled,</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory looked over at each other and burst into a hysterical, bewildered laughter. They were both feeling so many things in this moment... The Master had taken them on quite the Ride.
			“Twenty eight years we been running this same jig and every time it’s some bullshit! How many fucking choppers was that?! I said get two! Two! Not ten!” 
			The Master rattled off his cuffs and outstretched his arms as Buck moved to uncuff Raul and Gregory.
			“Hey, how about that ‘but but.. I’m black” bit?! Pretty damn good huh?!” chuckled the Master. 
			“It was very funny… a very nice touch Master. I swear your wit only gets sharper with age.” 
			The Master smiled a joyous smile. He turned to Raul and Gregory. 
			“Gentlemen, today has been quite the adventure… but this is just the beginning… you have taken the first step on a great journey… What you do from here is your own Choosing, it is of your own Will.. l am no longer of any use to you… as your hearts, and minds, and Mission will guide the way. I welcome you to the Path of the Pimp… Grab your envelopes off this table and go give life a good, hard fucking.” 
			The Master looked in Raul’s eyes and bowed his head. Then he looked in Gregory’s eyes and bowed his head. And with that, he grabbed his envelope off the table and began to sing “Fire and Rain” joyfully again as he sashayed out the door.				
			Raul and Gregory grabbed the brown manila envelopes tagged with their names, folded them down the center, shoved them in their pockets and headed out the door a moment behind The Master.  
			As they made their way out the front door of the building, Raul scanned the streets, expecting to get one last glimpse of the Master walking off into the distance, but the Master was nowhere in sight. As if by real Magic, the man had disappeared back into the mystical ether from which he first emerged.  
			As Raul pondered the mystery of the Master and surveyed the unknown world around him, he heard Gregory’s voice.
			“My brother… I guess there was room for two to walk the Path after all.”
			Raul looked back at Gregory with a warm smile. 
			“Yes… I suppose the Master’s tests and games knew no limit,” Raul responded. 
			“There’s a tavern at the end of this block, shall we start our journey with a drink?” said Gregory. 
			“I don’t think that’s a bad idea, my friend."</p>
