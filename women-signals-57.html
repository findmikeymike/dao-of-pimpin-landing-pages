                <p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Sheesh, we’re going a little over my pay grade here,” joked one of the men.
			“I think some part of you already gets it,” said the Master, with a knowing smile.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">From above the auditorium, came the humming whop-whop-whop of rotors. As the sound grew louder, it became clear—this wasn’t one helicopter, but a swarm. 
			The room was dead silent as the Master and the men listened intently. The humming swelled to a deafening blare, as if the choppers were hovering just above the roof. The anxious men looked to the Master, hoping his cool and calm Pimp demeanor would quell their anxiety, but for the first time, they saw in him The Fear… 
			“Aw shit…” whispered the Master in a wavy, desperation. 
			His chest started to beat like a drum, rising and falling with increasing speed. 
			Watching the Master surrender to the fear, the men spiraled into silent hysteria, and the symphony of racing hearts and shaky breathes resumed. 
			Over one of the helicopter’s megaphones a crisp and piercing voice commanded:
			“THIS IS THE FEDERAL POLICE OF JUSTICE. DO NOT MOVE A MUSCLE.”
			The men gasped and the symphony hit its crescendo—ten tactical ropes dropped from the rafters above, and like spiders, heavily armed men in pink helmets and all black armor scurried down into the auditorium. 
			“GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND, NOW!” screamed one of the Feds.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">As Raul stood to his feet he had a great realization: this moment had nothing to do with the Master, the men, the agents, or the Law. The film playing out before his eyes was his own creation, and the scene at hand an opportunity he had created to prove himself to Himself. And with that great realization something cracked in his mind, and for the first time in many years he felt Alive again. He could feel the blood in his veins and swelling of his testicles as he stared the Head Fed right in the eye... 
			“This man has done no evil! Especially not on behalf of the woman! For he has only taught of what her soul truly yearns, and for that which our own souls yearn as well! I stand by everything that has taken place here today!” Raul shouted.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">After fifty minutes, the van finally came to a halt and the doors swung open. By the bustling and busyness of the street outside it was clear they were in the downtown of a city, but anyone’s guess as to where exactly. 
			The federal agents grabbed the three men and yanked them out of the van. As they were steered into an old, brick building and prodded up a flight of stairs, the agents railed at them.
			“Move! Hurry it up, you fucking degenerates! We don’t have all day.”
			At the top of the stairs, the agents shoed them into a small, square room with plain white walls. Cameras in each corner stared down at them, poised to broadcast their images on the local late-night news as the most wicked and dangerous of men.
			The Head Fed followed the Master, Raul, and Gregory inside and shut the door behind them. In the middle of the room stood a black table and three brown envelopes, each tagged with their names. 
			“Gentlemen, inside each of these envelopes we have the official documentation and proof of each of your crimes. Now Mr. Davis won’t be going anywhere... but because I am an extremely forgiving man, I am going to give you two scoundrels one last opportunity to rebuke your crimes and agree to testify against Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.... and if you are willing to comply, you may go on your way,” the Head Fed said addressing Raul and Gregory. 
			“You heard the man. Do not be fools… my fate is already sealed, the show is over… go on your way,” said the Master.</p>
