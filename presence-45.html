<p class="student">Master, I've read many books on masculinity, but something is missing. What am I overlooking?</p>
<p class="master">“You missed a spot,” he snarled. 
			Raul’s blood began to boil. He had a fleeting vision of cracking the man over the head with the handle of his mop and flushing his remains down the toilet. It was not the first time he had been treated with such disrespect and contempt by his boss, but it was the most brash, and as infuriated as he was in the moment, there was a part of him that felt it was deserved. You are thirty-eight years old Raul! And this is how you spend your precious life? Cleaning toilets and replacing light bulbs for barbarians! Slaving away for pennies! It’s been twenty years now, Raul! Get it together!
			There was a more hopeful time in Raul’s life when he did have a Dream. He had grand and lucid visions of his very own janitorial company, ‘Delgado’s Diligent Cleaning.’ The most esteemed and prestigious cleaning service in all of Little Rock. Raul could see in vivid, crystallized color a satellite view of his vans crawling on every corner of the city. He saw people at stop lights giving the thumbs up to his workers and the occasional woman flashing her bosoms in the front yard as he passed in the ‘Boss Van’. He saw warm, pink suds soaking into terminally ill carpet, and a time-lapse of their resuscitations to a youthful vigor. 
			But as the gears of the galaxy churned on, and the years passed, and the hell-raising women crept in the cracks of his sad life to tap the last of his blood, the color and clarity of Raul’s visions faded away, leaving behind only the carcass of a Dream.. a pile of bones and a few shreds of dried meat. He needed a win in life, something… anything... to give him a bit of faith and keep him Going. 
			Raul pulled out of the Lake Crest parking lot and  floored it. His ’87 Volvo shrieked and wailed as it barreled down the open road, rattling maniacally as it surged to its top speed. The odometer read thirty-eight miles per hour. With the motel and all of its horror finally out of sight, Raul dug into his pocket, pulled out the mystical notecard, and placed it in his lap. He gently stroked the card with his thumb, over and over, as if to ensure its secrets would not escape. The cars behind him on the single lane road beeped in agony, just as they always did. “Forget them, Raul! Stay focused… You may just be holding the ticket to a new life, Raul!” he thought to himself. In four short days, he would have his answer.</p>
