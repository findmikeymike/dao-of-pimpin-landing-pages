                <p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">Somewhere in southern Florida at 4 A.M., Raul sat in a gigantic, windowless auditorium with 1,253 other broken and helpless men. The auditorium was cold and archaic, giving the impression it hadn’t seen a lick of activity in the last twenty years. The air in the room smelled like vinegar and mildew. The floor was stained a tainted shade of yellow. The room sizzled with nervous whisperings and squeaking chairs.
			It was nearly lunch hour, and a good portion of the men had lost all faith and left in a tizzy. “What kind of goddamn master books a shit-hole like this and shows up hours late!” they thought to themselves as they skidded out of the parking lot. As for the remaining men, they clung to the last tethers of hope, and as their hope withered and the ache of abandonment began to scream in their intestines—the lights went out in the auditorium… It was pitch fucking black. The whispering seized, and a piercing silence fell on the room. The men’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a few of them noticed something moving in their periphery… and then all of them noticed… a shadowy figure limped slowly towards the center of the stage.
			A circular, almost cartoonish spotlight clicked on and standing as still as a statue in the dead center of the light was a short, crinkled black man with a round gut. The gut hung lazily over his flowing, black velvet pants. What was left of his hair was frazzled and greying. He appeared to be in his mid-70s. His eyes scanned the room, his body remained motionless.
			Soft whisperings surfaced from the silence as the men appraised the static, velvet creature. “Surely this cannot be the master?! Where is our young, toned pussy slayer?! Where is He with a cock like thunder and the triceps of a mule?” a doubter whispered.					“What a disaster his jawline! What a ruse his vitality!” another chimed in. 
			Then, like an eruption, deep bellowing laughter surged through the speakers, echoing through the auditorium. When the last trail of the Velvet Man's laughter faded, there were exactly three seconds of a deadly hush, and then, with a deep and slow Southern draw, The Master spoke… 
			“You fucking cunts, look at you all… traveling from the edges of Earth, shelling the last of your humble earnings for a chance at a little pussy. You have been scammed yet again. But take solace in knowing you have helped me greatly. My debts are paid, and my future secure. I will not waste one penny of your hard earned money. I shall spend the rest of my days traveling to exotic islands, drinking the strongest liquors, and bedding the most beautiful harlots this world has ever birthed. I appreciate every one of you. You may go now.” 
			A scrawny man with a bowl cut took to his feet.
			“How dare you! How dare you swindle us in the hour of our greatest desperation! Burn in hell you old bandit!” he screeched. His body shook like an old motor on its last mile. A tear rolled down his face. The Master wailed in amusement. 
			“God strike this old devil with Syphilis and Scabies! Make him pay! Make his last days hellfire!” howled another naysayer.
			The Master clapped joyfully along to the men’s ranting and then, in a cool and calm voice replied, 
			“Yes, yes. That’s the spirit. The Good Lord has heard your request and added it to his To-Do list. You, too, are dismissed.” 
			Raul watched as the dejected men rose to their feet, steaming and screaming as they cast their stones at the stage. He wondered for which of these men it was the final straw, the last faint glimmer of hope being  devoured by the all-consuming darkness. Surely tomorrow there would be the news: “Heartbroken Simpleton, 31, found dead in a river.” Who would be the first to take that great leap? 
			One by one, the men shuffled towards the exit, cursing under their breath at themselves and the world. Raul continued to watch the men without moving. He was nine hundred miles from home with nowhere to go, nothing left to lose. His rage was exhausted. He had no will to stand, or leave, and so, he sat.  
			Within a few short moments, a room of over a thousand men had withered to thirty seven. The Master took off his shoes, sat down on the floor in the lotus position, tapped the microphone twice, and said, 
			“Now let us begin.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">The men howled and whistled in excitement. The Master shot up off the ground and back into perfect lotus posture, stared straight at Kapul and with a veiled joy in his voice replied, 
			“Don’t you dare move a muscle, Kapul... For if we were to let you loose on these streets… a savage like you… the rest of us would have to fight just for a chance to bend over that dead bird in the bush.” 
			The Master began to chuckle, and the men joined him. It was a nice moment, the Master and all the men sharing a laugh, a moment of true warmth and communion, a mome— 
			“SILENCE!” roared Master. 
			His empty glass flew across the room and shattered against something hard. He stared out at the men with a piercing and violent mania in his eyes. The men’s laughter seized so quickly it sounded as if someone had clicked a mute button on the room. They snapped back into upright position. Their pounding hearts and wavering breathes scored the silence like a symphony. The mania and madness in the Master’s eyes quickly faded back to a brilliant shimmer as he snickered, 
			“See what I did there? I took you for the Round Trip… The ol Pimp Special… Did you catch that Kapul?” 
			“Yes Master, believe it or not.. in the bliss of the moment, I had a strange feeling you were going to vault the energy and emotion of the room into a new direction. Your words have not fallen on deaf ears,” Gregory replied with a quiet pride. 
			“Well I’ll be damned… maybe Kapul is He after all!”
			Gregory turned his head to the men around him with a mischievous grin. He was not the man to count out.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">The Master took a deep breath and the fire returned to his voice.
			“Do you see Her now? Do you Understand the Reality of the creature that once made you tremble in fear? How could this creature ever Hurt you? What could she ever Take from you? Sear this image in your mind, picture it day and night, let it be the first thing you see in the morning, the last thing you see at night.. let it paint the skies of every dream you dream... and in time, the software of your mind that deals with women will take on a new shape, a new perception… one that is more in line with Reality… one that can immerse itself in a new Language… and as the script of this software is rewritten, the other softwares of the Mind too become more malleable, more unsure of themselves, and easier to adjust or destroy. This process is a key aspect of the evolution from man to Pimp… Now repeat after me: She is not the enemy. She is just like me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“Speak to us more of… the… Tests along the way, Master. It seems as if… as if… all of life itself is just one Test… after… another..” said the ginger man with a waver in his voice.
			“As I said before, the Tests of life, of the woman.. they are not the enemy. They are not a force of evil. They are your friend. They are there to aid and propel your evolution. Like everything else we have discussed today, the first step is to recognize and be conscious of the tests. Let’s go back to the woman, as her tests are relentless and a metaphor for all of life tests. The woman’s tests are a constant and endless check on man as to whether he is centered in himself and his Mission. The majority of you are here because you fail the very first test of the woman, and that is having a basic conviction in yourself. Her entire evolution has wired her to smell your bullshit from a mile away, as her evolutionary survival depended on it. You approach her and she senses your fear and incongruence, she senses you have no direction in your step, and her subconscious mind sounds the alarm: ‘He is afraid and shook by a 140-pound girl that wishes him no harm.. what will the world do to him?!’ And she is right!”
			The Master was in the Zone. The pace of his speech picked up as he continued.
			“Now let’s say you have some semblance of conviction and competence and you have begun dating a woman for a few months, and she says to you ‘I think its silly your refrigerator is full of sauces and find it a bit embarrassing to see you going door to door like a peasant trying hustle your sauce. My father said he would give you a real job.’ What does the average man do? He quits, in fear he may lose her... and on the surface she is happy, because here is a man that was so afraid to lose her, he gave up on The Mission. She feels validated in her Womanly Woo and influence, but beneath the surface, deep in her soul she is repulsed, and her attraction withers. The man was swayed from his own Will and Path by an outside opinion and a few unpleasant comments… How many of you have been this man? How many of you are still He?”
			Raul was the first to raise his hand. He had always been this man, oblivious to the glaringly obvious. His newfound clarity on a world once shrouded in mystery and chaos was truly emancipating. 
			The Master signaled for the men to put down their hands as he continued the teaching.
			“Know that she will plunder you with a barrage of trivial tests too, from the ‘I don’t like this song. Change it,’ to the ‘You would never really vote for that man, would you?’ All these can be translated into the same question ‘Are you a Pimp or a bitch? Are you about that life or are you not?’ And the correct answer is always your Truth, your Will, what you Want for Yourself... no matter how offended or disgruntled it may make her on the surface, know that on a deeper level you sticking to your guns and standing where you Choose to stand is what draws her closer and makes her gain trust in you as a man. And as for the true Pimp…”
			The Master smiled a devious smile.
			“The true Pimp who understands all of this knows how to flip the script on her entirely. He is on a date with a woman and starts deploying his own tests and challenges before she even has a chance to set the age old ‘I’m the woman and you are here to impress me… now here’s your first test’ frame. She scrambles as her Mechanical Mind is not used to being in such a peculiar and compromising position. He is tickled to see the true simp come out in her.. ‘No, no!’ she says, ‘I only went to see Maroon 5 because my friend had bought the tickets!’ The pimp chuckles in amusement and pokes at her, ‘Riiiiiight.. Check please!” 
			“Brilliant, sir! But… how on Earth is the woman so damn crafty? How many hours a day does she scheme on the man?” said a spirited young man.
			The Master had a good laugh at this. 
			“No, no… the vast majority of the time, a woman’s test are not consciously concocted. She is not off in some dark alley trading ‘catch the man’ tests with other women… The testing is wired and of an evolutionary nature. It is a survival mechanism of her subconscious mind to weed out the simps and weaklings from the true Pimps... and it is for this reason that her tests are not always easy to recognize... as you will not sense any level of deception or fuckery in the delivery of her tests… but know that until you have proved unwavering conviction in yourself and your Path, her tests, and the world’s tests, will not cease. Again, we must not see this is a burden, but a gift and service to keep you on your toes and steadfast on the Mission. Know that just like the undertaking of the Mission, we are not out to pass a woman’s tests to keep the woman or please the woman, we pass these tests for ourselves, for our own evolution. Her attraction is just a symptom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Raul the Pimp, 		Let the contents of this envelope serve you on 
	The Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>
