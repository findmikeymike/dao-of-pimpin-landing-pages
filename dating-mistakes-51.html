                <p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“This... sir.” said the timid ginger man with a tremble. 
			“This… this… what? Speak up!” said the Master. 
			“To… to… be put… on the spot… to speak pu… publicly.” he stammered. 
			“Ah! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly… and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me… Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night… the shame, the guilt… you cannot run from it… it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go ‘on the spot’ more… and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root… and like a hellish weed, it will rear it’s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender… Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?”
			The little ginger man’s face turned blood red. 
			“Ginger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre… tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.” 
			The little ginger man made an ‘Okay’ gesture with his hand and nodded his head. 
			“Say it out loud! Let us hear your voice!”
			“Okay,” said the man sheepishly.
			“We do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!” howled the Master.
			“OKAY,” the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">As Raul stood to his feet he had a great realization: this moment had nothing to do with the Master, the men, the agents, or the Law. The film playing out before his eyes was his own creation, and the scene at hand an opportunity he had created to prove himself to Himself. And with that great realization something cracked in his mind, and for the first time in many years he felt Alive again. He could feel the blood in his veins and swelling of his testicles as he stared the Head Fed right in the eye... 
			“This man has done no evil! Especially not on behalf of the woman! For he has only taught of what her soul truly yearns, and for that which our own souls yearn as well! I stand by everything that has taken place here today!” Raul shouted.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">In the back of the armored police van, the Master, Raul, and Gregory sat in complete silence. The Master had not lifted his head since his arrest. He had been broken... yet for Gregory and Raul, it made no difference who or what Sammy Davis Jr. truly was. They had heard Truth in his voice and his teachings, and the vessel through which those Truths were delivered made no difference to them. 
			Then, very quietly, with great beauty and tone, the Master began to sing weepingly: 
			“Oh I’ve seen fire and I’ve seen rain… I’ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end… I’ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend...” 
			He lifted his shoulder to his face and wiped away two tears. As he sniffled, he continued to sing quietly. Gregory and Raul glanced at each other, their faces blank and expressionless.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">After fifty minutes, the van finally came to a halt and the doors swung open. By the bustling and busyness of the street outside it was clear they were in the downtown of a city, but anyone’s guess as to where exactly. 
			The federal agents grabbed the three men and yanked them out of the van. As they were steered into an old, brick building and prodded up a flight of stairs, the agents railed at them.
			“Move! Hurry it up, you fucking degenerates! We don’t have all day.”
			At the top of the stairs, the agents shoed them into a small, square room with plain white walls. Cameras in each corner stared down at them, poised to broadcast their images on the local late-night news as the most wicked and dangerous of men.
			The Head Fed followed the Master, Raul, and Gregory inside and shut the door behind them. In the middle of the room stood a black table and three brown envelopes, each tagged with their names. 
			“Gentlemen, inside each of these envelopes we have the official documentation and proof of each of your crimes. Now Mr. Davis won’t be going anywhere... but because I am an extremely forgiving man, I am going to give you two scoundrels one last opportunity to rebuke your crimes and agree to testify against Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.... and if you are willing to comply, you may go on your way,” the Head Fed said addressing Raul and Gregory. 
			“You heard the man. Do not be fools… my fate is already sealed, the show is over… go on your way,” said the Master.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory entered the Tavern with an energy and ease they had never stepped into anywhere before…. like two young warriors who had just put their lives on the line for the first time and claimed victory in a fierce battle. Only an hour ago they’d been staring down a life behind bars... what was there to fear? Who or what could possibly Move them after a day like today? 
			As they approached the bar, a young hottie with tattoos grabbed Gregory’s arm. 
			“Hey daddy… how about a beer for the pretty lady? Hm? Buy me a beer?” yapped the hottie with an air of entitlement and expectation. 
			“Would you like my ATM number too?” Gregory replied in a calm, careless tone. 
			The girl was a bit taken aback. It was not what she expected to hear come out of this small Indian man’s mouth. 
			“Well, if you give me your ATM number, I could take you to get a haircut and maybe even get that dirty little mustache shaved off,” she challenged.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“Truthfully Lou… I have had a very long day but maybe another time,” Raul replied. 
			“Well, I had a great time with you and would love to see you again.. when are you free?” 
			“Aw hmm… You know I have a lot going on the next two weeks, but let’s keep in touch.” 
			It wasn’t that Raul lacked interest in her, it was just that he had much bigger things on his mind at the moment, and he Understood there was no rush. He would let the woman’s imagination and time preheat the oven as he attended to his next course of Action in life and on the Mission at hand.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">When Raul got home, he sank into the couch and pulled the brown envelope from his pocket. He unfolded the envelope and placed it on the table in front of him. 
			As he replayed the Magic and adventure of the day, he became curious about so many things. How did the Master know my name? I never even spoke it… and I used a fake name when I signed up? Where was Master from? How many able Pimps were out there?…  He even wondered what the fake legal documents detailing his ‘crimes of Pimping’ might look like, and how clever the Master’s final Test was. He thought about framing the document and posting it in his bedroom as a constant reminder of The Path. 
			Raul tore the envelope and reached inside. He pulled out a folded sheet of paper and read aloud to himself:</p>
