            <div class="master-student-dialogue">
                <p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Let us start at the beginning: You simps open your mouth to speak to a woman, and she is not moved. Hell, she’s usually appalled. She looks into your eyes and the fiery goddess deep within her subconscious immediately recognizes: this man does not Understand. This man does not know The Way. He is weak and confused, fearful and timid, he has no true life-force, no Presence or Awareness of this Great Unfolding and his journey will be no Ride… You hit her with your crafty lines and your bad boy smirk you practiced in the mirror for twelve hours, and little do you know, you have made the original mistake. You spoke to her in a language she does not speak. Your words have fallen on deaf ears.” 
			The Master raised his voice.
			“The true language of a woman makes not a sound. The true language and currency with a woman—and all humans for that matter—is Emotion. It is Feeling… And while there are many shades of emotion, many hues, there are only two true and primal emotions: Love and Fear. It is love and fear that cause the indescribable thump in her chest, the sweat in her palms. The little league player knows how to make her feel loved, the division one player knows how to deal her a bit of fear and anxiety, but the Pimp knows that it is neither love nor fear that truly fills the deepest yearnings of a woman’s soul.”
			The Master leaned forward and paused for a beat. He spoke slowly, with great intention. 
			“It is The Ride… the ride from love to fear, from fear to love, that ignite her bones and dampen her labias. It is in the Movement between these internal worlds that the power lies. It is The Ride that awakens her being, and reminds her that she is Here, Now… that something is Happening—and that she’s a part of it. It is The Ride, the exhilarating emotional journey, that she truly yearns, that she seeks.”
			The Master eased back into his default posture.
			“So when we talk about engaging with a woman, connecting with a woman, attracting a woman, banging the shit out of a woman, this is the language we are speaking, the language of Feeling. It is the cinder and soot the castle is built upon.”
			A skeptical man with slicked back hair, a gaudy satin shirt, and dark eyes snickered. He made sure his mockery of the Master was loud enough for all to hear.
			“Ha! Our words do not matter? A man can say ‘anything?’ A solid pick-up line cannot capture a woman?! Gimme a break!” scoffed the skeptical man with dark eyes.
			“My brooding Casanova, have these pre-rehearsed lines ever worked for you?” the Master snapped back.
			“My ‘name’ is Judas Finkleberry, and yes, in fact they do work. I have spent time with a ‘True’ Master, one who has given me a sequence of Words that can have even the most strident feminist butt-fucking-naked and begging for it in twenty minutes flat,” sneered the cynical Judas. 
			There were audible gasps from the men. The Master was tickled.
			“Oh is that so, Mr. Finklebobby? And I gather that is why you are here with us today? Because your incantations and spells are so potent with the woman?” replied the Master calmly.
			“Four words is all it takes…” said Judas with a scowl.
			“Get in my Ferrari!” jested the Master.
			The congregation of men snickered. Raul looked to Judas and sensed a heavy, metallic vibe about the man, as if he had been hurt by the world, and vowed to return the hurt by any means necessary. The Master turned his attention back to the believers. 
			“Let us proceed. And if The Dao proves false, we’ll all pitch in and pay our dear Judas for the real Magic. Deal?”
			The collective of men nodded in agreement.
			“What I am saying is that your words are only as useful as the Feelings they carry, a shell to transmit the real Language and Magic. The weight they hold is but a fart in the wind in comparison to the energy and emotion you create simply from your Presence. I am telling you that you can say damn near anything to a woman, yes damn near anything, and if You and your essence are in the right space, holding a certain Presence and ease, it will Move a woman far more than Mr. Finklebottom and his four sacred words. I’m saying that the energy and sound of your voice alone carry far more weight than the words that fall from the tongue.”
			The misanthropic Judas shook his head and looked at the Master with venom in his beady eyes. The Master paid no mind to his hostility and continued.
			“You are always asking what to say to a woman, and I’m telling you it is the wrong question. The reason you and ninety seven percent of men struggle so much with women is because you are eternally missing the forest for the trees. You are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. You have been walking around for damn near your entire life like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to figure out the mysteries of the woman, and every where you turn, someone else equally as confused is there to point you in the wrong direction.”
			“But Master how does one learn to speak this sacred language?” said a zealous man. 
			“How does one learn how to do anything? He studies very closely the one who does. You have seen men all your life who had that magic touch with women, but you were watching for all the wrong things. You assumed it must have been his classic smile or the tangerine scent of his cologne… I’m telling you to not just watch the man, but Feel him.. feel his jive, his ease, the rhythm he speaks at, the color he uses to describe the world around him.. I’m telling you to watch yourself, and your own emotions.”
			The Master stood up and began to pace the stage smoothly and slowly.
			“Imagine for a moment, you are speaking with a woman that by some strange glitch in the matrix does take interest in you, and you are going back and forth in swift digital conversation, and you are sure you’ve it in the bag, already picked out the fresh denim you are going to wear when you meet her, and the first surface in the house where you plan to make love to her, and then all sudden THWAP… crickets… She’s gone. Missing in action. Nowhere on the face of the mother fucking Earth to be found… What is it you feel? You feel the Fear. You fear you must have said something wrong, you fear your last line was not clever enough. You fear she met someone that was More than you… You were in the space of love, and excitement, and anticipation… and now in the blink of your god damn eye, all of that is gone, and all that’s left is fear. She has taken you for The Ride, and like a flaming bag of shit on the doorstep of your poor soul… you can’t look away. You can’t stop thinking about it. It gnaws at you and ignites something in you. You feel anger at yourself for another botch. And then out of no where, the bitch is back! She has risen like Christ! And she tells you she was just ‘caught up with some things and that her aunt had surgery’ and asks you ‘How are you’, and what do you feel? You feel the love again! You feel relieved it was not some idiotic thing you said. You feel excited you might still get to do some fuckin.. maybe even fall in love.. But then… as you obsessively re-read your conversation to get reacquainted with the dynamic and where you left off, you notice those three god forsaken little words: “How. Are. You.” and you start to get a funny feeling in your stomach. How am I? How - am - I? What happened to the heat and the romance? I address the goddamn Postman with more passion than that… The woman went from paragraphs of nonsense and emojicons, to those three lifeless little words… And now all the sudden, it’s the blink of an eye later, and she’s given you the the Pimp Special.. she’s taken you on the Round Trip… You felt the warm tingles of bliss running up your spine and in a single instant, kapoof—the tingles were gone, and you were riding the lightening 2,000 miles per hour straight back to the land of Fear…”
			The Master’s pace picked up speed as he continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Now let us face the beast: Fear… There is natural fear, the healthy fear that was programmed into the hardware of your mind at birth to keep you alive... this  fear is not the problem. The problem lies in the conditioned fear and aversions, the ones you have gathered along the journey that are irrational, and serve you in no way. The majority of these fears are of a social nature, and have to do with your acceptance in the tribe. There was a time when these fears served a purpose for man, as being cast out of the tribe meant certain death in the wild, but both man and the world alike have evolved. A man can survive and thrive on his own without the approval of the family, friends, and society around him. In many ways, his willingness to leave ‘The Group' is the beginning of his journey to his highest self, the true Pimp in him. Look at the life of any Christ or Buddha or great rockstar and you will see… they did not walk in line with society, they vowed for no man or woman’s approval… the Magic of their lives and stories was in opposition to these things.”
 			“Master, tell us more of dealing with these fears and entanglements,” exclaimed Gregory. 
			“First, we understand the difference between fear and aversion. Both must be conquered on the path to Pimpdom. The fear is what makes your heart race and hands shake. Aversions are the things that make you less comfortable in life and bring an unpleasantness to your mind. To unwrite these softwares of fear and aversion you have installed in the Mind, we first be conscious of them. For each of you has had different experiences and spun different webs… different Imprints… and accordingly, there will be different paths to their undoing. Let’s start with you, snacker with the lisp, tell me something that makes your skin crawl, something that strikes no fear in you, but you avoid like the plague.”
			“I hate being wet in clothing, sir. Especially jeans… I do not leave the house when it’s raining past a drizzle.” 
			“Well good gracious, imagine that… a grown man refusing to be involved with life and the world because he does not want to get a little wet. How much Magic and opportunity he may have missed lingering just beyond the rain… It was the Log Flume I presume?” 
			“Good god, Master? How—how could you have known? Yes, it was indeed the Log Flume. I remember being ten years old at the waterpark and the woman guaranteeing me if I sat in the back I would not take on any water… at worst a light mist. I was soaked to the bone and my breasts and rolls protruded from my t-shirt and the other children called me the Flume Whale for nearly a year!” 
			“And as the pain and embarrassment of such an archetypal scene was branded with a hot iron into the Mind, the Web began to spin… the fear left a trail… a present day aversion… and a very silly thing that holds you back in life. It will only continue to hinder you so we must destroy it at once! I want you to put on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt every single day for the next month and have your neighbor dowse you with a hose before you leave your house. I mean drenched and dripping to the damn bone. When you are soaked to the bone, I want you to verbally say aloud, ‘Out with all remnants and noise of the past, for they are but a dream. I am baptized in these waters and made clean again.’ Then go about your business as usual... The first few days you will think of nothing but your discomfort, but with each passing day, you will become used to it. Your mind will accept that you are wet and surrender its useless fight... and day by day the imprint in your mind will begin to evaporate, hell you may even begin to enjoy the cool sensation it brings and how alert you have become. You may start enjoying it so goddamn much you have to pay your neighbor a monthly salary to hose you down in your clothes everyday...” 
			“Master I have no relation with my neighbors.” 
			“Then it will be one hell of an ice breaker... ‘Hello my good man, would you mind spraying me with your fucking hose?’ What sane man could refuse such good fun?”
			“But Master if—”
			The pudgy man tried to interject but was steamrolled by the impassioned Master.
			“After you have completed this torrential month, I want you to repeat the process, but this time, I want you out in the world shirtless. Let those titties swing and that belly shake. For we must get to the root of this web, right down to the fear that birthed it.”
			The pudgy man with the lisp opened his mouth to respond but the Master pressed on.
			“Now let us move on to someone else. You there... little ginger man with the large nose, hiding his head… yes, you… what is that haunts your dreams?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">The Head Fed set down his gun on the table and lit a cigarette ablaze. As he exhaled a waft of smoke, he began to slow clap, and in a cool calm tone, he spoke,
			“Gentlemen… it is with the Master’s blessings I hereby announce you Pimp’s of the First Degree. Congratulations and welcome to The Path.” 
			“Now get these fucking cuffs off us…  Jesus, Buck!.. how many times have I told you not to cuff me so fucking tight.. I’m not as nimble as I used to be... I’m an old ass man!” zipped the Master. 
			“At once, Master! Just making sure you haven’t gone full simp on us! My apologies sir!” the ‘Fed’ replied as he scurried behind the Master to finagle his cuffs.</p>
