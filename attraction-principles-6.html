                <p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">In the back of the armored police van, the Master, Raul, and Gregory sat in complete silence. The Master had not lifted his head since his arrest. He had been broken... yet for Gregory and Raul, it made no difference who or what Sammy Davis Jr. truly was. They had heard Truth in his voice and his teachings, and the vessel through which those Truths were delivered made no difference to them. 
			Then, very quietly, with great beauty and tone, the Master began to sing weepingly: 
			“Oh I’ve seen fire and I’ve seen rain… I’ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end… I’ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend...” 
			He lifted his shoulder to his face and wiped away two tears. As he sniffled, he continued to sing quietly. Gregory and Raul glanced at each other, their faces blank and expressionless.</p>
