                <p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“She is not the enemy. She is just like me!” Shouted the men devoted men. 
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” yelled The Master.
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” chanted the choir. 
			“She shits and she does not always wash!”
			“She shits and she does not always wash!” they roared! 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“Very good,” said the Master. 
			“Hold tight to the mantra, men! The mantra is all we need!” shouted the chubby man with the lisp.
 			The Master threw his hand up in the air to halt the blossoming of a false notion.
			“No! For this is just the beginning! This is only one mantra, one practice, one compartment of the Mind. We will not stop here… We must eliminate not just the Web of the Woman, but every web you have ever spun!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I understand that may be the case Master, but I must admit, no amount of logic or reasoning seems to dull the pain. I still am absorbed in the pain. It is unwavering.. and I cannot see myself with anyone else but her... how can one deal?” 
			“Again you are only living in the truth of the Now, of the emotion you feel in this very moment. And those emotions will fade and morph into new emotions in time. Can you acknowledge this?”
			“Yes. Yes I understand, sir,” replied the sorrowful man.
			“Let’s start with addressing the core feeling you are left with: aloneness. You imagine that gut wrenching heartbreak you feel is unlike anything anyone else on this Earth could ever imagine. But you must know it is an ignorant and arrogant thought... Almost every single person you pass on the street has felt that same all-consuming pain. They have lost someone they held just as dear, yet there they are, marching on… many of them with new partners or love interests. I want you to look at every one of those people, really look at them, and know they came out the other side, and your fate will be the same. With this simple awareness in the mind let's move on to the real work: cutting out the web and imprint this woman has left behind.”
			The Master rubbed his hands together and rolled his neck.
			“Just as you have spun your webs of fear, you have spun a web with this woman. I want you to sit down at a table with a pen and pad... go back in your mind to the very first girl you ever loved or had a passionate crush on… all the way back.. It may have been kindergarten or 2nd grade. Now, write down her name. Go through all the years of your life, and write down all the names. Don’t skip a single love or infatuation.. You should have fifteen, thirty, fifty names on your list. At the bottom, the last name you will add to the list is the one who just broke you. Now starting with the very first name on the list, the very first girl you loved… I want you to see her in your mind’s eye. There are borders framing this memory of her... push on the boarders of this memory, look outside the frame. Step all the way in it, remember the way she smelled, and the tone of her voice... feel that rush of life and love you felt when you were near her... the tingle that ran up the back of your neck when you sat next to her in math class and your arms brushed lightly upon each others. Remember how much you loved her, and how in the moment you could have never imagined feeling that way about any other girl. When you are fully submerged in the feeling, when all that Magic has hit you again, let it fade. Step back outside the memory and back to the now. Watch as all that passion, all that love, the whole trip dissolves back into the nothingness of the Now. Go through every name on your list and repeat the process. Notice the world of love and emotion you had for each woman and how with time and each new Love Trip, the prior woman faded into oblivion. Now look at the last name on the list, the one who just broke you, and See that she is just another name on the list. Know that like all the others, her influence on your emotional state is destined to fade and give way to a new name. See the whole thing, the whole list for what it is: an emotional Trip. Realize that each name is but an emotional oasis in a desert of the mundane. Look at that list and ask yourself: what is this? What is this about? Is this evolving list of romantic entanglements ‘It’? Is this the highest pursuit of a man’s life?”
			The Master paused, and tilted his head.
			“That is not a rhetorical question. Is this man’s greatest pursuit?!”
			“No!” they shouted.
			“Should this impermanent dance be the center of my universe and dictate the way I live and operate? Man must ask himself if he wants to spend his short and fragile life hunting for the cheese in the closet or pushing Beyond... evolving his spirit… if this was all just about women and pussy, you could be falling in love and screwing your brains out in a whore house right now… I think each of you is aware by now that mastery with women is just a symbol, a metaphor for a bliss and conquering of Something much Greater in your life.”
			“The pain aside, how does one deal with the betrayal? The idea of my girl being penetrated by another man… it haunts my dreams,” exclaimed the heart-broken man.
			“Let’s first look at this Fear very closely. You are afraid of your woman going to bed with another man. The idea of another man penetrating your little pumpkin pie is like a knife in your gut. But why? What about this scene is so haunting? You’re well aware she has most likely had an army of penises inside her before you were together? And those cause you no agony? So we can deduce from this logic that it is not the idea of another man penetrating your woman that is the issue. The issue is her taking another man’s penis after You were there. And if we prone a bit more we find that the real Fear is that some man after you will be More than you. He will be more charismatic, or more talented, or better looking, or have a bigger pipe.. And because there is a chance he is More, you feel less than... you feel inferior, inadequate, weak, unlovable.. So the heart of this matter isn’t in her or him, or his penis inside of her… it lies in you, and the way you feel about and perceive yourself. Know this fear will not cease, the nightmares will not cease, until something major has changed in You. Now we could give you more systems, more practices, another mantra to help cut this web from the mind, but you men must realize by now, the webs you have spun are endless, and it is going to be on you to use the blueprint and framework of our prior practices to guide your way.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>

Two… Manipulation of Historical Sexual Dynamics. Three… Radicalizing and Sexually Weaponizing Males. Four… Collecting money in Women Endangering Pursuits… last but not least, Five— using the word “Faggot” and “bitch” among other terms deemed unlawful. We have all of this on tape.” 
			The Master dropped his head and began to sob. 
			“But… but... I’m Black?" he whimpered.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">In the back of the armored police van, the Master, Raul, and Gregory sat in complete silence. The Master had not lifted his head since his arrest. He had been broken... yet for Gregory and Raul, it made no difference who or what Sammy Davis Jr. truly was. They had heard Truth in his voice and his teachings, and the vessel through which those Truths were delivered made no difference to them. 
			Then, very quietly, with great beauty and tone, the Master began to sing weepingly: 
			“Oh I’ve seen fire and I’ve seen rain… I’ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end… I’ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend...” 
			He lifted his shoulder to his face and wiped away two tears. As he sniffled, he continued to sing quietly. Gregory and Raul glanced at each other, their faces blank and expressionless.</p>
