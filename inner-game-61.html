                <p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“This... sir.” said the timid ginger man with a tremble. 
			“This… this… what? Speak up!” said the Master. 
			“To… to… be put… on the spot… to speak pu… publicly.” he stammered. 
			“Ah! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly… and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me… Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night… the shame, the guilt… you cannot run from it… it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go ‘on the spot’ more… and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root… and like a hellish weed, it will rear it’s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender… Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?”
			The little ginger man’s face turned blood red. 
			“Ginger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre… tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.” 
			The little ginger man made an ‘Okay’ gesture with his hand and nodded his head. 
			“Say it out loud! Let us hear your voice!”
			“Okay,” said the man sheepishly.
			“We do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!” howled the Master.
			“OKAY,” the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I understand that may be the case Master, but I must admit, no amount of logic or reasoning seems to dull the pain. I still am absorbed in the pain. It is unwavering.. and I cannot see myself with anyone else but her... how can one deal?” 
			“Again you are only living in the truth of the Now, of the emotion you feel in this very moment. And those emotions will fade and morph into new emotions in time. Can you acknowledge this?”
			“Yes. Yes I understand, sir,” replied the sorrowful man.
			“Let’s start with addressing the core feeling you are left with: aloneness. You imagine that gut wrenching heartbreak you feel is unlike anything anyone else on this Earth could ever imagine. But you must know it is an ignorant and arrogant thought... Almost every single person you pass on the street has felt that same all-consuming pain. They have lost someone they held just as dear, yet there they are, marching on… many of them with new partners or love interests. I want you to look at every one of those people, really look at them, and know they came out the other side, and your fate will be the same. With this simple awareness in the mind let's move on to the real work: cutting out the web and imprint this woman has left behind.”
			The Master rubbed his hands together and rolled his neck.
			“Just as you have spun your webs of fear, you have spun a web with this woman. I want you to sit down at a table with a pen and pad... go back in your mind to the very first girl you ever loved or had a passionate crush on… all the way back.. It may have been kindergarten or 2nd grade. Now, write down her name. Go through all the years of your life, and write down all the names. Don’t skip a single love or infatuation.. You should have fifteen, thirty, fifty names on your list. At the bottom, the last name you will add to the list is the one who just broke you. Now starting with the very first name on the list, the very first girl you loved… I want you to see her in your mind’s eye. There are borders framing this memory of her... push on the boarders of this memory, look outside the frame. Step all the way in it, remember the way she smelled, and the tone of her voice... feel that rush of life and love you felt when you were near her... the tingle that ran up the back of your neck when you sat next to her in math class and your arms brushed lightly upon each others. Remember how much you loved her, and how in the moment you could have never imagined feeling that way about any other girl. When you are fully submerged in the feeling, when all that Magic has hit you again, let it fade. Step back outside the memory and back to the now. Watch as all that passion, all that love, the whole trip dissolves back into the nothingness of the Now. Go through every name on your list and repeat the process. Notice the world of love and emotion you had for each woman and how with time and each new Love Trip, the prior woman faded into oblivion. Now look at the last name on the list, the one who just broke you, and See that she is just another name on the list. Know that like all the others, her influence on your emotional state is destined to fade and give way to a new name. See the whole thing, the whole list for what it is: an emotional Trip. Realize that each name is but an emotional oasis in a desert of the mundane. Look at that list and ask yourself: what is this? What is this about? Is this evolving list of romantic entanglements ‘It’? Is this the highest pursuit of a man’s life?”
			The Master paused, and tilted his head.
			“That is not a rhetorical question. Is this man’s greatest pursuit?!”
			“No!” they shouted.
			“Should this impermanent dance be the center of my universe and dictate the way I live and operate? Man must ask himself if he wants to spend his short and fragile life hunting for the cheese in the closet or pushing Beyond... evolving his spirit… if this was all just about women and pussy, you could be falling in love and screwing your brains out in a whore house right now… I think each of you is aware by now that mastery with women is just a symbol, a metaphor for a bliss and conquering of Something much Greater in your life.”
			“The pain aside, how does one deal with the betrayal? The idea of my girl being penetrated by another man… it haunts my dreams,” exclaimed the heart-broken man.
			“Let’s first look at this Fear very closely. You are afraid of your woman going to bed with another man. The idea of another man penetrating your little pumpkin pie is like a knife in your gut. But why? What about this scene is so haunting? You’re well aware she has most likely had an army of penises inside her before you were together? And those cause you no agony? So we can deduce from this logic that it is not the idea of another man penetrating your woman that is the issue. The issue is her taking another man’s penis after You were there. And if we prone a bit more we find that the real Fear is that some man after you will be More than you. He will be more charismatic, or more talented, or better looking, or have a bigger pipe.. And because there is a chance he is More, you feel less than... you feel inferior, inadequate, weak, unlovable.. So the heart of this matter isn’t in her or him, or his penis inside of her… it lies in you, and the way you feel about and perceive yourself. Know this fear will not cease, the nightmares will not cease, until something major has changed in You. Now we could give you more systems, more practices, another mantra to help cut this web from the mind, but you men must realize by now, the webs you have spun are endless, and it is going to be on you to use the blueprint and framework of our prior practices to guide your way.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">The metal chairs screeched in agony as the men pushed them aside and dove to the floor. 	Raul’s head hit the musky floor, inches from Gregory’s. He couldn’t help but notice the thousand microscopic beads of sweat sliding down Gregory’s mini mustache. 
			“Do you think… think this may be… a test, brother?” Gregory whispered as soft as a mouse. 
			“A test! Did you see the Fear in Master’s eyes? These are Federal Agents, Gregory! This is no theatre,” Raul hissed back. 
			Gregory squeezed his eyes shut and began to pant. The armed men had surrounded them now, their rifles aimed to kill. 
			There were six armed men on stage surrounding the Master. Two of the men grabbed the Master’s arms from behind with violent force, slamming cuffs on his wrists. The Master wailed in agony.  The leader of the Fed team knelt down in front of the Master and snarled,</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory looked over at each other and burst into a hysterical, bewildered laughter. They were both feeling so many things in this moment... The Master had taken them on quite the Ride.
			“Twenty eight years we been running this same jig and every time it’s some bullshit! How many fucking choppers was that?! I said get two! Two! Not ten!” 
			The Master rattled off his cuffs and outstretched his arms as Buck moved to uncuff Raul and Gregory.
			“Hey, how about that ‘but but.. I’m black” bit?! Pretty damn good huh?!” chuckled the Master. 
			“It was very funny… a very nice touch Master. I swear your wit only gets sharper with age.” 
			The Master smiled a joyous smile. He turned to Raul and Gregory. 
			“Gentlemen, today has been quite the adventure… but this is just the beginning… you have taken the first step on a great journey… What you do from here is your own Choosing, it is of your own Will.. l am no longer of any use to you… as your hearts, and minds, and Mission will guide the way. I welcome you to the Path of the Pimp… Grab your envelopes off this table and go give life a good, hard fucking.” 
			The Master looked in Raul’s eyes and bowed his head. Then he looked in Gregory’s eyes and bowed his head. And with that, he grabbed his envelope off the table and began to sing “Fire and Rain” joyfully again as he sashayed out the door.				
			Raul and Gregory grabbed the brown manila envelopes tagged with their names, folded them down the center, shoved them in their pockets and headed out the door a moment behind The Master.  
			As they made their way out the front door of the building, Raul scanned the streets, expecting to get one last glimpse of the Master walking off into the distance, but the Master was nowhere in sight. As if by real Magic, the man had disappeared back into the mystical ether from which he first emerged.  
			As Raul pondered the mystery of the Master and surveyed the unknown world around him, he heard Gregory’s voice.
			“My brother… I guess there was room for two to walk the Path after all.”
			Raul looked back at Gregory with a warm smile. 
			“Yes… I suppose the Master’s tests and games knew no limit,” Raul responded. 
			“There’s a tavern at the end of this block, shall we start our journey with a drink?” said Gregory. 
			“I don’t think that’s a bad idea, my friend."</p>
