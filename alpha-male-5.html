                <p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Master speak to us of the Process… in real life, how one begins this transformation,” said one of devout men. 
			“Before you splash one drop of shitty cologne on your neck or step one toe towards the Path of the Pimp... you must know the reality. You must know that in this moment, you and every man around you is only flirting with an idea, finger-blasting a beautiful fantasy. Like all the greatest things on the journey of life, it will take every drop of blood in your veins, every bead of sweat your skin can muster, for the unlikely chance at Pimpdom. The Path of the Pimp will take much work—it will take pain, a hell-storm of discomfort and embarrassment... Look at the man beside you, now look around the room…”
			The Master paused for a moment as the men surveyed those around them. He continued,
			“Now think back to the assembly of hemorrhoidal lumps who scampered out of here and rushed home to their infernos of emptiness before the show even began... and hear the Truth: In this moment, you think I am talking to you, that I am here for you, and that this room is some sort of mystical fraternity of rejects that are off to slay the dragon together. You imagine us meeting up a few years down the line, drinking cocktails and eating chicken fingers, busting each other's chops, and sharing nude screenshots of beautiful women in compromising positions… Yet again, you have fallen for the Fairy Tale and deceived yourself. The truth is, I am here today, right now, in this very fucking moment speaking to One man. It is he, and only he that I am speaking to. It is he, and only he, that has the chance to walk the Path of the Pimp. The rest of you are nothing more than extras cast for an hourly rate to fill his story with color and motion. So I ask you now, in your heart of hearts: are you He? If not, I am promising you this endeavor is not only a waste of your time, but will cause more pain and discomfort.”
			Twelve men got up and left the room. The remaining men got up and filled their seats closer to the Master. Raul, Gregory, and the chubby man with the lisp sat front and center. Judas, the lone wolf, refused to yield to the Master and stayed put in his seat, just close enough to lob his grenades, but far enough to feel untouchable.
			The air of camaraderie was gone. The feeling of Simp fellowship and Beta brotherhood, liquidated. For every man now Understood that if by the grace of the Almighty Pimp it was his mission, he would be going alone... 
			“Master I don’t presume you will tell us which man here is He, but may I ask if you think there is any hope for me in particular? Could you imagine me ever becoming even the lowliest of Pimps with a generous effort? I work many hours of the week, sir, but I am determined to have my pie.” 
			The Master laughed hysterically. He laughed so hard he fell backwards out of his upright posture and was laid flat on the ground. It took him a full minute to compose himself. The room was silent again, and while still laid out flat on his back, the Master spoke in a soft and sympathetic tone. 
			“Kapul, if my opinion is what you seek... I could not imagine you fucking a dead bird in a bush, let alone a woman. You’re a computer technician… a computer tech-nish-an... and nothing more. You were born to chip away at motherboards and untangle snake pits of electronic cords. You are weak, your mustache, repulsive… Your little hands equipped to your body for no other reason than to place bottles of discount lotion up by the register, your eyes, only placed in your skull to scan obscure pornography until the hour when night meets day. There is no hope for you. No hope at all. It gives me no pleasure to say this, Kapul… You are dismissed.”
 			And with his words, a different type of silence fell on the room of men. A silence so sad and empty it was as if the world itself stopped spinning to pay its respect to the complete annihilation of a human soul. Gregory sat there like a stone, the blood from his face and what remained of his erection drained down into his little feet. The hairs of his mustache curled inwards, as if the last drops of life and sweat had been snuffed out of them. They had given it everything they had, trying to convince the world that together they were a real mustache, but the time had come when they could no longer even fool themselves. 	For Gregory and the Mini Mustache, the voyage to the ‘Land of a Thousand Yearning Pussys and Maybe a Good Wife,’ was over. 
			“Go on now little Indian man! Surely there are some other gay little Indians you can seduce at the local curry hole! The rest of us want to hear what other nonsense this ‘Master’ has in store!” Judas snipped. 
			Gregory began to rise to his feet but a swift and strong arm jerked him back down.				“Who are these men to tell you your fate? If the Master’s words are Truth, then it is you— and you alone— who decides what Awaits you. Do not fail yourself, Kapul,” Raul whispered with an unusual conviction. 
			There was a gleam in Gregory’s left eye, and then a gleam in the right. He leaned into Raul, paused for a beat, and whispered back:
			“For you my brother in pussy, anti-virus scan… any time… free of charge.”
 			Gregory shot a wink at Raul, turned to the Master, who was still laid out on the floor, and shouted.
			“But Master you made no mention of my tongue! And I am only left to assume it is because you fear the tsunami it could unleash in between the thighs of the woman you love most… ‘Yes Kapul, yes,’ she says.. ‘I can’t wait a minute longer Kapul.. Pound these thick cheeks with that Anaconda, Kapul.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>
