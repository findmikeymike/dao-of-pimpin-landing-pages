                <p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">Somewhere in southern Florida at 4 A.M., Raul sat in a gigantic, windowless auditorium with 1,253 other broken and helpless men. The auditorium was cold and archaic, giving the impression it hadn’t seen a lick of activity in the last twenty years. The air in the room smelled like vinegar and mildew. The floor was stained a tainted shade of yellow. The room sizzled with nervous whisperings and squeaking chairs.
			It was nearly lunch hour, and a good portion of the men had lost all faith and left in a tizzy. “What kind of goddamn master books a shit-hole like this and shows up hours late!” they thought to themselves as they skidded out of the parking lot. As for the remaining men, they clung to the last tethers of hope, and as their hope withered and the ache of abandonment began to scream in their intestines—the lights went out in the auditorium… It was pitch fucking black. The whispering seized, and a piercing silence fell on the room. The men’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a few of them noticed something moving in their periphery… and then all of them noticed… a shadowy figure limped slowly towards the center of the stage.
			A circular, almost cartoonish spotlight clicked on and standing as still as a statue in the dead center of the light was a short, crinkled black man with a round gut. The gut hung lazily over his flowing, black velvet pants. What was left of his hair was frazzled and greying. He appeared to be in his mid-70s. His eyes scanned the room, his body remained motionless.
			Soft whisperings surfaced from the silence as the men appraised the static, velvet creature. “Surely this cannot be the master?! Where is our young, toned pussy slayer?! Where is He with a cock like thunder and the triceps of a mule?” a doubter whispered.					“What a disaster his jawline! What a ruse his vitality!” another chimed in. 
			Then, like an eruption, deep bellowing laughter surged through the speakers, echoing through the auditorium. When the last trail of the Velvet Man's laughter faded, there were exactly three seconds of a deadly hush, and then, with a deep and slow Southern draw, The Master spoke… 
			“You fucking cunts, look at you all… traveling from the edges of Earth, shelling the last of your humble earnings for a chance at a little pussy. You have been scammed yet again. But take solace in knowing you have helped me greatly. My debts are paid, and my future secure. I will not waste one penny of your hard earned money. I shall spend the rest of my days traveling to exotic islands, drinking the strongest liquors, and bedding the most beautiful harlots this world has ever birthed. I appreciate every one of you. You may go now.” 
			A scrawny man with a bowl cut took to his feet.
			“How dare you! How dare you swindle us in the hour of our greatest desperation! Burn in hell you old bandit!” he screeched. His body shook like an old motor on its last mile. A tear rolled down his face. The Master wailed in amusement. 
			“God strike this old devil with Syphilis and Scabies! Make him pay! Make his last days hellfire!” howled another naysayer.
			The Master clapped joyfully along to the men’s ranting and then, in a cool and calm voice replied, 
			“Yes, yes. That’s the spirit. The Good Lord has heard your request and added it to his To-Do list. You, too, are dismissed.” 
			Raul watched as the dejected men rose to their feet, steaming and screaming as they cast their stones at the stage. He wondered for which of these men it was the final straw, the last faint glimmer of hope being  devoured by the all-consuming darkness. Surely tomorrow there would be the news: “Heartbroken Simpleton, 31, found dead in a river.” Who would be the first to take that great leap? 
			One by one, the men shuffled towards the exit, cursing under their breath at themselves and the world. Raul continued to watch the men without moving. He was nine hundred miles from home with nowhere to go, nothing left to lose. His rage was exhausted. He had no will to stand, or leave, and so, he sat.  
			Within a few short moments, a room of over a thousand men had withered to thirty seven. The Master took off his shoes, sat down on the floor in the lotus position, tapped the microphone twice, and said, 
			“Now let us begin.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Who is next? You, Judas, what is it you fear?”			
			“I fear being conned by Snakes who claim to know the Way,” he snipped back with a deadly spite.
			“And yet you have no awareness that You are the true con of your own narrative. Your mind is a fortress of fear, on a suicide mission to Prove… Always trying to Prove… For the man so enslaved in this hellish realm misses the Whole of Life, held captive by the claws of his own ego. He wants so desperately to be shaken, to be woken from his slumber but his pride is so booming and monstrous, it drowns outs every ringing bell.”
			“Kiss - my - ass - you old coon,” Judas spit back.
			The room froze. All eyes turned to The Master. His face was carved from stone—utterly devoid of any emotion. With a piercing calm, he hiked up his velvet pants, stepped to the edge of the stage, and dropped his old bones over the lip. He moved with purpose now—skirting around the rows of chairs like a serpent coiling its prey. With each footstep, the room seemed to shift. More force. More weight. More speed. Then he lurched—a full bodied surge—straight toward Judas, never breaking his searing gaze on the man for a second. The congregation of men were on edge of their seats. Their fear and awe of the moment hung in the air.. 
			With each step closer the Master came, Judas’s testicles shrank three millimeters. The muscles in his body began to clench so tightly they were on the verge of incineration. His gelled hair was so brittle you could hear the crackling and smoldering. 
			As the Master closed in, Judas began to shake violently. He squeezed his eyes shut and clenched at his guts, summoning every atom of strength not to shit himself… and then…  in the infinite silence and black of his mind, he felt something… in his ear… a deep penetration—slimy, turbulent, relentless. He whimpered in helpless agony as the walls of his canal were stretched and shredded. As the penetration came to its climax, he heard the pitched-down laughter and chanting of the men, and a faint robotic voice shout:
			“W E T   W I L L Y ! ! !”
			Judas crumbled. His body, his mind, his soul… violated and pillaged in slow motion, pumped and dumped by an ungodly force.
			“Judas, the fun is over. I have finished. Now Open - Your - Eyes,” The Master said softly.  
			With a pounding breath, Judas timidly cracked open his left eye. The Master grabbed him forcefully by the cheeks, and with his face mere centimeters from Judas’s, he commanded:
			“It is time to Wake Up my boy. You do not know why you came here today, but I do… You came for this moment. For this very. fucking. moment.”
			The Master let go of his cheeks and began to ease his face away from Judas’s ever so slowly. As the Master walked back to the stage he shouted buoyantly and clapped his hands.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“We love you master! We shall meet you in Pussy Heaven!” 
			The Master’s disciples scurried eagerly out of the auditorium. There was a new world awaiting them. A world of pussy, and Magic, and foul smelling toilets… As Raul walked towards the exit, he savored the Master’s last words, and as he savored each of them, he was struck dead in his track. “A dame has called on me. I must go. A dame has called on me. I must go.” Master? Leave his Mission for the beckoning call of a woman? Leave men in the birthplace of true Understanding for a quick and trivial nut? Oh Raul! You were almost fooled! A test so obvious! Look at the energy and impatience of these men that walk beside you! They are in fantasy land! 
			Raul turned and started back towards the stage. There were a handful of perceptive men who had not left their chairs. Raul reclaimed his seat next to Gregory, one of the few Unmovable devotees. Gregory leaned in to him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">In the back of the armored police van, the Master, Raul, and Gregory sat in complete silence. The Master had not lifted his head since his arrest. He had been broken... yet for Gregory and Raul, it made no difference who or what Sammy Davis Jr. truly was. They had heard Truth in his voice and his teachings, and the vessel through which those Truths were delivered made no difference to them. 
			Then, very quietly, with great beauty and tone, the Master began to sing weepingly: 
			“Oh I’ve seen fire and I’ve seen rain… I’ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end… I’ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend...” 
			He lifted his shoulder to his face and wiped away two tears. As he sniffled, he continued to sing quietly. Gregory and Raul glanced at each other, their faces blank and expressionless.</p>
