                <p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">Somewhere in southern Florida at 4 A.M., Raul sat in a gigantic, windowless auditorium with 1,253 other broken and helpless men. The auditorium was cold and archaic, giving the impression it hadn’t seen a lick of activity in the last twenty years. The air in the room smelled like vinegar and mildew. The floor was stained a tainted shade of yellow. The room sizzled with nervous whisperings and squeaking chairs.
			It was nearly lunch hour, and a good portion of the men had lost all faith and left in a tizzy. “What kind of goddamn master books a shit-hole like this and shows up hours late!” they thought to themselves as they skidded out of the parking lot. As for the remaining men, they clung to the last tethers of hope, and as their hope withered and the ache of abandonment began to scream in their intestines—the lights went out in the auditorium… It was pitch fucking black. The whispering seized, and a piercing silence fell on the room. The men’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a few of them noticed something moving in their periphery… and then all of them noticed… a shadowy figure limped slowly towards the center of the stage.
			A circular, almost cartoonish spotlight clicked on and standing as still as a statue in the dead center of the light was a short, crinkled black man with a round gut. The gut hung lazily over his flowing, black velvet pants. What was left of his hair was frazzled and greying. He appeared to be in his mid-70s. His eyes scanned the room, his body remained motionless.
			Soft whisperings surfaced from the silence as the men appraised the static, velvet creature. “Surely this cannot be the master?! Where is our young, toned pussy slayer?! Where is He with a cock like thunder and the triceps of a mule?” a doubter whispered.					“What a disaster his jawline! What a ruse his vitality!” another chimed in. 
			Then, like an eruption, deep bellowing laughter surged through the speakers, echoing through the auditorium. When the last trail of the Velvet Man's laughter faded, there were exactly three seconds of a deadly hush, and then, with a deep and slow Southern draw, The Master spoke… 
			“You fucking cunts, look at you all… traveling from the edges of Earth, shelling the last of your humble earnings for a chance at a little pussy. You have been scammed yet again. But take solace in knowing you have helped me greatly. My debts are paid, and my future secure. I will not waste one penny of your hard earned money. I shall spend the rest of my days traveling to exotic islands, drinking the strongest liquors, and bedding the most beautiful harlots this world has ever birthed. I appreciate every one of you. You may go now.” 
			A scrawny man with a bowl cut took to his feet.
			“How dare you! How dare you swindle us in the hour of our greatest desperation! Burn in hell you old bandit!” he screeched. His body shook like an old motor on its last mile. A tear rolled down his face. The Master wailed in amusement. 
			“God strike this old devil with Syphilis and Scabies! Make him pay! Make his last days hellfire!” howled another naysayer.
			The Master clapped joyfully along to the men’s ranting and then, in a cool and calm voice replied, 
			“Yes, yes. That’s the spirit. The Good Lord has heard your request and added it to his To-Do list. You, too, are dismissed.” 
			Raul watched as the dejected men rose to their feet, steaming and screaming as they cast their stones at the stage. He wondered for which of these men it was the final straw, the last faint glimmer of hope being  devoured by the all-consuming darkness. Surely tomorrow there would be the news: “Heartbroken Simpleton, 31, found dead in a river.” Who would be the first to take that great leap? 
			One by one, the men shuffled towards the exit, cursing under their breath at themselves and the world. Raul continued to watch the men without moving. He was nine hundred miles from home with nowhere to go, nothing left to lose. His rage was exhausted. He had no will to stand, or leave, and so, he sat.  
			Within a few short moments, a room of over a thousand men had withered to thirty seven. The Master took off his shoes, sat down on the floor in the lotus position, tapped the microphone twice, and said, 
			“Now let us begin.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“Let us start at the beginning: You simps open your mouth to speak to a woman, and she is not moved. Hell, she’s usually appalled. She looks into your eyes and the fiery goddess deep within her subconscious immediately recognizes: this man does not Understand. This man does not know The Way. He is weak and confused, fearful and timid, he has no true life-force, no Presence or Awareness of this Great Unfolding and his journey will be no Ride… You hit her with your crafty lines and your bad boy smirk you practiced in the mirror for twelve hours, and little do you know, you have made the original mistake. You spoke to her in a language she does not speak. Your words have fallen on deaf ears.” 
			The Master raised his voice.
			“The true language of a woman makes not a sound. The true language and currency with a woman—and all humans for that matter—is Emotion. It is Feeling… And while there are many shades of emotion, many hues, there are only two true and primal emotions: Love and Fear. It is love and fear that cause the indescribable thump in her chest, the sweat in her palms. The little league player knows how to make her feel loved, the division one player knows how to deal her a bit of fear and anxiety, but the Pimp knows that it is neither love nor fear that truly fills the deepest yearnings of a woman’s soul.”
			The Master leaned forward and paused for a beat. He spoke slowly, with great intention. 
			“It is The Ride… the ride from love to fear, from fear to love, that ignite her bones and dampen her labias. It is in the Movement between these internal worlds that the power lies. It is The Ride that awakens her being, and reminds her that she is Here, Now… that something is Happening—and that she’s a part of it. It is The Ride, the exhilarating emotional journey, that she truly yearns, that she seeks.”
			The Master eased back into his default posture.
			“So when we talk about engaging with a woman, connecting with a woman, attracting a woman, banging the shit out of a woman, this is the language we are speaking, the language of Feeling. It is the cinder and soot the castle is built upon.”
			A skeptical man with slicked back hair, a gaudy satin shirt, and dark eyes snickered. He made sure his mockery of the Master was loud enough for all to hear.
			“Ha! Our words do not matter? A man can say ‘anything?’ A solid pick-up line cannot capture a woman?! Gimme a break!” scoffed the skeptical man with dark eyes.
			“My brooding Casanova, have these pre-rehearsed lines ever worked for you?” the Master snapped back.
			“My ‘name’ is Judas Finkleberry, and yes, in fact they do work. I have spent time with a ‘True’ Master, one who has given me a sequence of Words that can have even the most strident feminist butt-fucking-naked and begging for it in twenty minutes flat,” sneered the cynical Judas. 
			There were audible gasps from the men. The Master was tickled.
			“Oh is that so, Mr. Finklebobby? And I gather that is why you are here with us today? Because your incantations and spells are so potent with the woman?” replied the Master calmly.
			“Four words is all it takes…” said Judas with a scowl.
			“Get in my Ferrari!” jested the Master.
			The congregation of men snickered. Raul looked to Judas and sensed a heavy, metallic vibe about the man, as if he had been hurt by the world, and vowed to return the hurt by any means necessary. The Master turned his attention back to the believers. 
			“Let us proceed. And if The Dao proves false, we’ll all pitch in and pay our dear Judas for the real Magic. Deal?”
			The collective of men nodded in agreement.
			“What I am saying is that your words are only as useful as the Feelings they carry, a shell to transmit the real Language and Magic. The weight they hold is but a fart in the wind in comparison to the energy and emotion you create simply from your Presence. I am telling you that you can say damn near anything to a woman, yes damn near anything, and if You and your essence are in the right space, holding a certain Presence and ease, it will Move a woman far more than Mr. Finklebottom and his four sacred words. I’m saying that the energy and sound of your voice alone carry far more weight than the words that fall from the tongue.”
			The misanthropic Judas shook his head and looked at the Master with venom in his beady eyes. The Master paid no mind to his hostility and continued.
			“You are always asking what to say to a woman, and I’m telling you it is the wrong question. The reason you and ninety seven percent of men struggle so much with women is because you are eternally missing the forest for the trees. You are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. You have been walking around for damn near your entire life like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to figure out the mysteries of the woman, and every where you turn, someone else equally as confused is there to point you in the wrong direction.”
			“But Master how does one learn to speak this sacred language?” said a zealous man. 
			“How does one learn how to do anything? He studies very closely the one who does. You have seen men all your life who had that magic touch with women, but you were watching for all the wrong things. You assumed it must have been his classic smile or the tangerine scent of his cologne… I’m telling you to not just watch the man, but Feel him.. feel his jive, his ease, the rhythm he speaks at, the color he uses to describe the world around him.. I’m telling you to watch yourself, and your own emotions.”
			The Master stood up and began to pace the stage smoothly and slowly.
			“Imagine for a moment, you are speaking with a woman that by some strange glitch in the matrix does take interest in you, and you are going back and forth in swift digital conversation, and you are sure you’ve it in the bag, already picked out the fresh denim you are going to wear when you meet her, and the first surface in the house where you plan to make love to her, and then all sudden THWAP… crickets… She’s gone. Missing in action. Nowhere on the face of the mother fucking Earth to be found… What is it you feel? You feel the Fear. You fear you must have said something wrong, you fear your last line was not clever enough. You fear she met someone that was More than you… You were in the space of love, and excitement, and anticipation… and now in the blink of your god damn eye, all of that is gone, and all that’s left is fear. She has taken you for The Ride, and like a flaming bag of shit on the doorstep of your poor soul… you can’t look away. You can’t stop thinking about it. It gnaws at you and ignites something in you. You feel anger at yourself for another botch. And then out of no where, the bitch is back! She has risen like Christ! And she tells you she was just ‘caught up with some things and that her aunt had surgery’ and asks you ‘How are you’, and what do you feel? You feel the love again! You feel relieved it was not some idiotic thing you said. You feel excited you might still get to do some fuckin.. maybe even fall in love.. But then… as you obsessively re-read your conversation to get reacquainted with the dynamic and where you left off, you notice those three god forsaken little words: “How. Are. You.” and you start to get a funny feeling in your stomach. How am I? How - am - I? What happened to the heat and the romance? I address the goddamn Postman with more passion than that… The woman went from paragraphs of nonsense and emojicons, to those three lifeless little words… And now all the sudden, it’s the blink of an eye later, and she’s given you the the Pimp Special.. she’s taken you on the Round Trip… You felt the warm tingles of bliss running up your spine and in a single instant, kapoof—the tingles were gone, and you were riding the lightening 2,000 miles per hour straight back to the land of Fear…”
			The Master’s pace picked up speed as he continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“I understand that may be the case Master, but I must admit, no amount of logic or reasoning seems to dull the pain. I still am absorbed in the pain. It is unwavering.. and I cannot see myself with anyone else but her... how can one deal?” 
			“Again you are only living in the truth of the Now, of the emotion you feel in this very moment. And those emotions will fade and morph into new emotions in time. Can you acknowledge this?”
			“Yes. Yes I understand, sir,” replied the sorrowful man.
			“Let’s start with addressing the core feeling you are left with: aloneness. You imagine that gut wrenching heartbreak you feel is unlike anything anyone else on this Earth could ever imagine. But you must know it is an ignorant and arrogant thought... Almost every single person you pass on the street has felt that same all-consuming pain. They have lost someone they held just as dear, yet there they are, marching on… many of them with new partners or love interests. I want you to look at every one of those people, really look at them, and know they came out the other side, and your fate will be the same. With this simple awareness in the mind let's move on to the real work: cutting out the web and imprint this woman has left behind.”
			The Master rubbed his hands together and rolled his neck.
			“Just as you have spun your webs of fear, you have spun a web with this woman. I want you to sit down at a table with a pen and pad... go back in your mind to the very first girl you ever loved or had a passionate crush on… all the way back.. It may have been kindergarten or 2nd grade. Now, write down her name. Go through all the years of your life, and write down all the names. Don’t skip a single love or infatuation.. You should have fifteen, thirty, fifty names on your list. At the bottom, the last name you will add to the list is the one who just broke you. Now starting with the very first name on the list, the very first girl you loved… I want you to see her in your mind’s eye. There are borders framing this memory of her... push on the boarders of this memory, look outside the frame. Step all the way in it, remember the way she smelled, and the tone of her voice... feel that rush of life and love you felt when you were near her... the tingle that ran up the back of your neck when you sat next to her in math class and your arms brushed lightly upon each others. Remember how much you loved her, and how in the moment you could have never imagined feeling that way about any other girl. When you are fully submerged in the feeling, when all that Magic has hit you again, let it fade. Step back outside the memory and back to the now. Watch as all that passion, all that love, the whole trip dissolves back into the nothingness of the Now. Go through every name on your list and repeat the process. Notice the world of love and emotion you had for each woman and how with time and each new Love Trip, the prior woman faded into oblivion. Now look at the last name on the list, the one who just broke you, and See that she is just another name on the list. Know that like all the others, her influence on your emotional state is destined to fade and give way to a new name. See the whole thing, the whole list for what it is: an emotional Trip. Realize that each name is but an emotional oasis in a desert of the mundane. Look at that list and ask yourself: what is this? What is this about? Is this evolving list of romantic entanglements ‘It’? Is this the highest pursuit of a man’s life?”
			The Master paused, and tilted his head.
			“That is not a rhetorical question. Is this man’s greatest pursuit?!”
			“No!” they shouted.
			“Should this impermanent dance be the center of my universe and dictate the way I live and operate? Man must ask himself if he wants to spend his short and fragile life hunting for the cheese in the closet or pushing Beyond... evolving his spirit… if this was all just about women and pussy, you could be falling in love and screwing your brains out in a whore house right now… I think each of you is aware by now that mastery with women is just a symbol, a metaphor for a bliss and conquering of Something much Greater in your life.”
			“The pain aside, how does one deal with the betrayal? The idea of my girl being penetrated by another man… it haunts my dreams,” exclaimed the heart-broken man.
			“Let’s first look at this Fear very closely. You are afraid of your woman going to bed with another man. The idea of another man penetrating your little pumpkin pie is like a knife in your gut. But why? What about this scene is so haunting? You’re well aware she has most likely had an army of penises inside her before you were together? And those cause you no agony? So we can deduce from this logic that it is not the idea of another man penetrating your woman that is the issue. The issue is her taking another man’s penis after You were there. And if we prone a bit more we find that the real Fear is that some man after you will be More than you. He will be more charismatic, or more talented, or better looking, or have a bigger pipe.. And because there is a chance he is More, you feel less than... you feel inferior, inadequate, weak, unlovable.. So the heart of this matter isn’t in her or him, or his penis inside of her… it lies in you, and the way you feel about and perceive yourself. Know this fear will not cease, the nightmares will not cease, until something major has changed in You. Now we could give you more systems, more practices, another mantra to help cut this web from the mind, but you men must realize by now, the webs you have spun are endless, and it is going to be on you to use the blueprint and framework of our prior practices to guide your way.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">Raul stared blankly at the check for a moment. Part of him was in disbelief, as if he had dreamed whole charade.. He ran his finger softly down the spine of the check and accepted the Moment for what it was… a blessing, a new beginning… another shot at Life and the Dream.
			 Raul walked over to the closet and began shuffling through stacks of old magazines. He stopped and pulled out a worn catalog: Janitorial Worldwide. Flipping through it quickly, he stopped on a page with a faded bookmark. On the marked page was a picture of a high-tech janitorial van. Inside the van was an entire array of state-of-the-art cleaning tools and machinery. 
			Raul pulled out his phone and dialed. It rang once, and then clicked over to a voice message.
			“Hello, this is Raul Delgado. I’d like to place an order for two SCV7’s... And if at all possible, I would like to have flaming vacuums painted on the sides of both… and my logo of course… Please call me at 323-457-8794.” 
			After hanging up, he retrieved the check off the table, slid it into his wallet—then paused. Something else caught his eye inside. He pulled out a small card, read the number, and dialed. It rang four times before a familiar voice snapped:
			“Who the fuck ca—" barked the voice—But before the man could finish he was steamrolled by the cool and impassioned Pimp Raul.
			“Yes boss. This is Raul Delgado from Lake Crest… yes, Raul... I’m aware it’s 2 A.M... I figured it is the hour your wife gets the most horney sir… and seeing as it is a sheer impossibility she could ever get to your little dick under all that disgusting, hideous flubber, I was wondering if I dropped by and gave her some real pipe, the pipe she dreams about all day long, if you wouldn’t consider a promotion and handsome raise for me sir?”
			Raul’s eyes glowed like a sacred fire. He had tapped fully into a flow state of Fearless Presence as he spoke,
			“Fired, sir? Kill me, sir? How dare you… I offer a favor, and this is how you repay me?!” 
			Raul hung up the phone and let out a primal wail of the most joyous laughter. It rang through the halls of his apartment like a war cry and an exorcism. Like a true Pimp, he slowly reclined back into his couch with a big old shit-eating grin stretched across his face. 				He was a man reclaiming his legend—the same legend buried in every man, burning to be Remembered. Some will hear the Call. Others will be taken for the Ride. But in the end, there is only One Real Question every man must answer: Are you a Pimp… or a bitch?</p>
