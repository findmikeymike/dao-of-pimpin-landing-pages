                <p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Now let us face the beast: Fear… There is natural fear, the healthy fear that was programmed into the hardware of your mind at birth to keep you alive... this  fear is not the problem. The problem lies in the conditioned fear and aversions, the ones you have gathered along the journey that are irrational, and serve you in no way. The majority of these fears are of a social nature, and have to do with your acceptance in the tribe. There was a time when these fears served a purpose for man, as being cast out of the tribe meant certain death in the wild, but both man and the world alike have evolved. A man can survive and thrive on his own without the approval of the family, friends, and society around him. In many ways, his willingness to leave ‘The Group' is the beginning of his journey to his highest self, the true Pimp in him. Look at the life of any Christ or Buddha or great rockstar and you will see… they did not walk in line with society, they vowed for no man or woman’s approval… the Magic of their lives and stories was in opposition to these things.”
 			“Master, tell us more of dealing with these fears and entanglements,” exclaimed Gregory. 
			“First, we understand the difference between fear and aversion. Both must be conquered on the path to Pimpdom. The fear is what makes your heart race and hands shake. Aversions are the things that make you less comfortable in life and bring an unpleasantness to your mind. To unwrite these softwares of fear and aversion you have installed in the Mind, we first be conscious of them. For each of you has had different experiences and spun different webs… different Imprints… and accordingly, there will be different paths to their undoing. Let’s start with you, snacker with the lisp, tell me something that makes your skin crawl, something that strikes no fear in you, but you avoid like the plague.”
			“I hate being wet in clothing, sir. Especially jeans… I do not leave the house when it’s raining past a drizzle.” 
			“Well good gracious, imagine that… a grown man refusing to be involved with life and the world because he does not want to get a little wet. How much Magic and opportunity he may have missed lingering just beyond the rain… It was the Log Flume I presume?” 
			“Good god, Master? How—how could you have known? Yes, it was indeed the Log Flume. I remember being ten years old at the waterpark and the woman guaranteeing me if I sat in the back I would not take on any water… at worst a light mist. I was soaked to the bone and my breasts and rolls protruded from my t-shirt and the other children called me the Flume Whale for nearly a year!” 
			“And as the pain and embarrassment of such an archetypal scene was branded with a hot iron into the Mind, the Web began to spin… the fear left a trail… a present day aversion… and a very silly thing that holds you back in life. It will only continue to hinder you so we must destroy it at once! I want you to put on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt every single day for the next month and have your neighbor dowse you with a hose before you leave your house. I mean drenched and dripping to the damn bone. When you are soaked to the bone, I want you to verbally say aloud, ‘Out with all remnants and noise of the past, for they are but a dream. I am baptized in these waters and made clean again.’ Then go about your business as usual... The first few days you will think of nothing but your discomfort, but with each passing day, you will become used to it. Your mind will accept that you are wet and surrender its useless fight... and day by day the imprint in your mind will begin to evaporate, hell you may even begin to enjoy the cool sensation it brings and how alert you have become. You may start enjoying it so goddamn much you have to pay your neighbor a monthly salary to hose you down in your clothes everyday...” 
			“Master I have no relation with my neighbors.” 
			“Then it will be one hell of an ice breaker... ‘Hello my good man, would you mind spraying me with your fucking hose?’ What sane man could refuse such good fun?”
			“But Master if—”
			The pudgy man tried to interject but was steamrolled by the impassioned Master.
			“After you have completed this torrential month, I want you to repeat the process, but this time, I want you out in the world shirtless. Let those titties swing and that belly shake. For we must get to the root of this web, right down to the fear that birthed it.”
			The pudgy man with the lisp opened his mouth to respond but the Master pressed on.
			“Now let us move on to someone else. You there... little ginger man with the large nose, hiding his head… yes, you… what is that haunts your dreams?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">From above the auditorium, came the humming whop-whop-whop of rotors. As the sound grew louder, it became clear—this wasn’t one helicopter, but a swarm. 
			The room was dead silent as the Master and the men listened intently. The humming swelled to a deafening blare, as if the choppers were hovering just above the roof. The anxious men looked to the Master, hoping his cool and calm Pimp demeanor would quell their anxiety, but for the first time, they saw in him The Fear… 
			“Aw shit…” whispered the Master in a wavy, desperation. 
			His chest started to beat like a drum, rising and falling with increasing speed. 
			Watching the Master surrender to the fear, the men spiraled into silent hysteria, and the symphony of racing hearts and shaky breathes resumed. 
			Over one of the helicopter’s megaphones a crisp and piercing voice commanded:
			“THIS IS THE FEDERAL POLICE OF JUSTICE. DO NOT MOVE A MUSCLE.”
			The men gasped and the symphony hit its crescendo—ten tactical ropes dropped from the rafters above, and like spiders, heavily armed men in pink helmets and all black armor scurried down into the auditorium. 
			“GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND, NOW!” screamed one of the Feds.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“And what matters is your Will, your Truth, and what you believe to be Right.. the world will try it’s best to push back, make you cave… but Man must conquer the Fear… he must never back down... at the end of the day there is only one real Question… will man choose Action or death. Are you a Pimp or a bitch, Raul?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">Raul the Pimp, 		Let the contents of this envelope serve you on 
	The Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>
