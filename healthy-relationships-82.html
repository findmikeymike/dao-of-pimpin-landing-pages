            <div class="master-student-dialogue">
                <p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Let us start at the beginning: You simps open your mouth to speak to a woman, and she is not moved. Hell, she’s usually appalled. She looks into your eyes and the fiery goddess deep within her subconscious immediately recognizes: this man does not Understand. This man does not know The Way. He is weak and confused, fearful and timid, he has no true life-force, no Presence or Awareness of this Great Unfolding and his journey will be no Ride… You hit her with your crafty lines and your bad boy smirk you practiced in the mirror for twelve hours, and little do you know, you have made the original mistake. You spoke to her in a language she does not speak. Your words have fallen on deaf ears.” 
			The Master raised his voice.
			“The true language of a woman makes not a sound. The true language and currency with a woman—and all humans for that matter—is Emotion. It is Feeling… And while there are many shades of emotion, many hues, there are only two true and primal emotions: Love and Fear. It is love and fear that cause the indescribable thump in her chest, the sweat in her palms. The little league player knows how to make her feel loved, the division one player knows how to deal her a bit of fear and anxiety, but the Pimp knows that it is neither love nor fear that truly fills the deepest yearnings of a woman’s soul.”
			The Master leaned forward and paused for a beat. He spoke slowly, with great intention. 
			“It is The Ride… the ride from love to fear, from fear to love, that ignite her bones and dampen her labias. It is in the Movement between these internal worlds that the power lies. It is The Ride that awakens her being, and reminds her that she is Here, Now… that something is Happening—and that she’s a part of it. It is The Ride, the exhilarating emotional journey, that she truly yearns, that she seeks.”
			The Master eased back into his default posture.
			“So when we talk about engaging with a woman, connecting with a woman, attracting a woman, banging the shit out of a woman, this is the language we are speaking, the language of Feeling. It is the cinder and soot the castle is built upon.”
			A skeptical man with slicked back hair, a gaudy satin shirt, and dark eyes snickered. He made sure his mockery of the Master was loud enough for all to hear.
			“Ha! Our words do not matter? A man can say ‘anything?’ A solid pick-up line cannot capture a woman?! Gimme a break!” scoffed the skeptical man with dark eyes.
			“My brooding Casanova, have these pre-rehearsed lines ever worked for you?” the Master snapped back.
			“My ‘name’ is Judas Finkleberry, and yes, in fact they do work. I have spent time with a ‘True’ Master, one who has given me a sequence of Words that can have even the most strident feminist butt-fucking-naked and begging for it in twenty minutes flat,” sneered the cynical Judas. 
			There were audible gasps from the men. The Master was tickled.
			“Oh is that so, Mr. Finklebobby? And I gather that is why you are here with us today? Because your incantations and spells are so potent with the woman?” replied the Master calmly.
			“Four words is all it takes…” said Judas with a scowl.
			“Get in my Ferrari!” jested the Master.
			The congregation of men snickered. Raul looked to Judas and sensed a heavy, metallic vibe about the man, as if he had been hurt by the world, and vowed to return the hurt by any means necessary. The Master turned his attention back to the believers. 
			“Let us proceed. And if The Dao proves false, we’ll all pitch in and pay our dear Judas for the real Magic. Deal?”
			The collective of men nodded in agreement.
			“What I am saying is that your words are only as useful as the Feelings they carry, a shell to transmit the real Language and Magic. The weight they hold is but a fart in the wind in comparison to the energy and emotion you create simply from your Presence. I am telling you that you can say damn near anything to a woman, yes damn near anything, and if You and your essence are in the right space, holding a certain Presence and ease, it will Move a woman far more than Mr. Finklebottom and his four sacred words. I’m saying that the energy and sound of your voice alone carry far more weight than the words that fall from the tongue.”
			The misanthropic Judas shook his head and looked at the Master with venom in his beady eyes. The Master paid no mind to his hostility and continued.
			“You are always asking what to say to a woman, and I’m telling you it is the wrong question. The reason you and ninety seven percent of men struggle so much with women is because you are eternally missing the forest for the trees. You are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. You have been walking around for damn near your entire life like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to figure out the mysteries of the woman, and every where you turn, someone else equally as confused is there to point you in the wrong direction.”
			“But Master how does one learn to speak this sacred language?” said a zealous man. 
			“How does one learn how to do anything? He studies very closely the one who does. You have seen men all your life who had that magic touch with women, but you were watching for all the wrong things. You assumed it must have been his classic smile or the tangerine scent of his cologne… I’m telling you to not just watch the man, but Feel him.. feel his jive, his ease, the rhythm he speaks at, the color he uses to describe the world around him.. I’m telling you to watch yourself, and your own emotions.”
			The Master stood up and began to pace the stage smoothly and slowly.
			“Imagine for a moment, you are speaking with a woman that by some strange glitch in the matrix does take interest in you, and you are going back and forth in swift digital conversation, and you are sure you’ve it in the bag, already picked out the fresh denim you are going to wear when you meet her, and the first surface in the house where you plan to make love to her, and then all sudden THWAP… crickets… She’s gone. Missing in action. Nowhere on the face of the mother fucking Earth to be found… What is it you feel? You feel the Fear. You fear you must have said something wrong, you fear your last line was not clever enough. You fear she met someone that was More than you… You were in the space of love, and excitement, and anticipation… and now in the blink of your god damn eye, all of that is gone, and all that’s left is fear. She has taken you for The Ride, and like a flaming bag of shit on the doorstep of your poor soul… you can’t look away. You can’t stop thinking about it. It gnaws at you and ignites something in you. You feel anger at yourself for another botch. And then out of no where, the bitch is back! She has risen like Christ! And she tells you she was just ‘caught up with some things and that her aunt had surgery’ and asks you ‘How are you’, and what do you feel? You feel the love again! You feel relieved it was not some idiotic thing you said. You feel excited you might still get to do some fuckin.. maybe even fall in love.. But then… as you obsessively re-read your conversation to get reacquainted with the dynamic and where you left off, you notice those three god forsaken little words: “How. Are. You.” and you start to get a funny feeling in your stomach. How am I? How - am - I? What happened to the heat and the romance? I address the goddamn Postman with more passion than that… The woman went from paragraphs of nonsense and emojicons, to those three lifeless little words… And now all the sudden, it’s the blink of an eye later, and she’s given you the the Pimp Special.. she’s taken you on the Round Trip… You felt the warm tingles of bliss running up your spine and in a single instant, kapoof—the tingles were gone, and you were riding the lightening 2,000 miles per hour straight back to the land of Fear…”
			The Master’s pace picked up speed as he continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“But to take a woman on the Ride, to purposely manipulate… is that not pure deception? Is it not just more confusion in the world? A bid for the Shadow?’ interjected an astute and doubtful man.
			“Ah! A thinker walks among us! A fair and important question… Understand this my friend, sex is warfare, and some wars are inevitable. The very nature of the act itself is rooted in an act of aggression, and almost every move to get it, by man or woman—a subconsciously concocted manipulation. You drive a nice car to manipulate her perception of your status. She applies her cherry lipgloss to make you dream of her wet, juicy snatch. If men and women did not play this game, and did not find ways to attract and conquer each other, it would be the death of their species, so would it be fair to call this evil? If it takes some level of seduction for sex to ever occur, is it fair to damn the one who Understands versus the one who guesses or succeeds by happenstance? If it is somehow ‘evil,' it is clearly a necessary and natural one set in motion by the Almighty Pimp himself… Just know, for man, this game—this calculated behavior—is only temporary. When a man becomes a Pimp, there is no manipulation, no deceit necessary. Your essence, your mission, your passion will provide for the ultimate Ride in and of itself. You will not go cold at the zenith of your conversation with a beautiful woman out of tactic. You will go cold on her and pop back in two weeks later because there is something in your life of far greater importance. Her presence will become a genuine afterthought on your journey, and then, and only then, can her power over you be destroyed.” 
			“Master, how does one embark on this Path and still hold onto Himself, though?” barked a chubby man with a lisp.
			The Master’s head fell and shook gently side to side.
			“Hold on to Himself? Is ‘He’ not the cause of all your troubles, and exactly why you are here today? Should the three-hundred -pound woman with buffalo sauce on her blouse and thick black hairs running down her thighs—who showers once a season and complains about everything—just ‘be herself’ and expect you to love and chase her to the edge of the Earth? Enough with the Fairy Tales! The truth is ‘Who You Are’ in this moment, to a woman and the world alike, is of no interest or value, he brings no life or Feeling to the party. ‘He’ has never taken you anywhere in life but because you have gotten to know him so well, become so comfortable with him, you are afraid to leave him behind, and explore what lies Beyond. You must understand that your personality is nothing more than a collection of thoughts, feelings, and ideas from the past. It is an illusion, created to give you a false sense of identity and position in the world. You cling to it for safety and comfort—and it hinders you!” 
			“You hear that? An imaginary bag of shit floating in the wind! That’s all we are… how charming, ” snarled the dark eyed Judas.
			The Master continued as if Judas was invisible.
			“Your essence is fluid and ever-evolving. ‘Who You Are’ is whoever you Choose to be in any given moment. There are no boundaries to You, no limitations other than the ones you have carved into your Mechanical Mind. So I say to you, lighten up… enjoy the freedom, embrace the fluidity, have a little fun with ‘Yourself.’ Go try on some new personalities and behaviors, be the thing most unnatural to you. As you begin to let go of the identity you once gripped so tightly, you will notice a powerful thing start to happen: you will get a little looser, get a little more jive in your step… you will begin to notice how the world and women react differently to your Presence. You will start to realize the reason for those reactions, and the energy that truly moves the world… and this new You—not wasting all its energy and power trying to protect an ego or clinging to an idea, will have room for Presence and Magic. Soon enough this new state of Being will become as genuine and One with you as your original state of simpotry and stiffness once was. No fakery, no mystical lines necessary… The world will try its goddamn best to push back, make you cave, make you crawl back into your old shell, but you have drunk the sacred juice from the labias of the Almighty fountain, the Pimp has been born, and there is no going back… The Simp may be who you are, who you were, but he can easily be erased, and replaced with whomever it is you Choose. Even you, Mr. Finklefeet…” 
			Judas snickered and shook his head.
			“Master, for one who is very tied to his past, his ego.. who is self-admittedly close minded and rigid in identity, how can he go about separating from the old Him?” said a smokey voiced believer.
			“Think to the Method actor. Immerse yourself in someone Else. Go get yourself a cowboy hat, cowboy boots, some Levi denim and Marlboro Reds and go be the cowboy for a few days, or weeks, or months… Define Who he is and what makes him tick. Fully inhabit and operate as him throughout your day. Pick up your groceries as He… Make phone calls to women as He… become He in every last sense. Over time, as the line between You and He gets blurry, when you do not know which name to respond to, or you find yourself doing his hyena laugh, or holding a fork with the other hand, the idea of Who You Are will become less definite, more flexible… You will most likely find that right off the bat, you are far smoother and at ease with women and the world, as there will be no need to protect the ego you spent thirty years constructing. There will be a deep sense of liberation, and you may even find you enjoy your life more as the cowboy… or the Catholic priest, or the androgynous narcoleptic trucker, or whoever the hell it is that gives your spirit new Life.”
			As the Master sat back down in the lotus position and sipped his water, Raul saw a kaleidoscopic montage of himself as an array of eccentric characters swirling in his mind’s eye. He hopped from vision to vision, trying on different outfits and attitudes, inhabiting different worlds and socializing with all kinds of colorful characters. He remembered being twenty two and coming home one day in a black leather Harley jacket and how mercilessly Julia, his first wife, laughed at him. ‘Raul, you damn fool! Those jackets are made for hot bikers, not janitors. Did you get a kickstand for your mop, too?’ Raul hadn’t yet told her about his desire to get an old motorcycle, or his fantasies of the two of them taking late-night rides to escape the monotony of their days. He remembered the next afternoon, when he stuffed this vision into the pocket of the jacket and handed it back to the owner of the pawn shop, and the owner saying ‘Clutch gotcha huh?’… and the look of confusion and mild disgust on the man’s face when he replied, “The clutch of my wife.” And oddly, he felt a certain sense of peace with the memory. There was Somewhere in him that said maybe it wasn’t over… Maybe hidden under piles of Barbara Streisand vinyl and weary old lamp shades, in some dusty storage room of that pawn shop on Dunlevy Avenue, the tasseled Harley jacket would still be there, waiting for him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“This... sir.” said the timid ginger man with a tremble. 
			“This… this… what? Speak up!” said the Master. 
			“To… to… be put… on the spot… to speak pu… publicly.” he stammered. 
			“Ah! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly… and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me… Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night… the shame, the guilt… you cannot run from it… it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go ‘on the spot’ more… and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root… and like a hellish weed, it will rear it’s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender… Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?”
			The little ginger man’s face turned blood red. 
			“Ginger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre… tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.” 
			The little ginger man made an ‘Okay’ gesture with his hand and nodded his head. 
			“Say it out loud! Let us hear your voice!”
			“Okay,” said the man sheepishly.
			“We do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!” howled the Master.
			“OKAY,” the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“So he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself ‘the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,’ so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: ‘The first five rounds are on you.’ Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn’t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn’t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn’t for another two weeks—suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?”
			“I am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!” Gregory shouted without hesitation.
			“Yes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.’ This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of ‘losing’ some girl he doesn’t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.”
			“Sir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women… but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?” replied a curious believer.
			“No, no, no… you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I’m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from… a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call… I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot… there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself ‘How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?’ You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.”  
			“So I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?” replied the man.
			“No—on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection… for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp’s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man’s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">Raul reached into the bottom of the envelope and felt something tucked inside. In the bottom left corner was a small, neatly folder square of paper.. Raul pulled it out and unfolded it. It was a check.</p>
