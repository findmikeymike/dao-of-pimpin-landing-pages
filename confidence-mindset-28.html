                <p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">That afternoon, as Raul mopped the scum off the floor of the Lake Crest Motel’s bathroom, his mind spun in every direction. He pawed at his eyes, but the strange blue tint cast over his world would not wane. 
			A grossly overweight man with a tacky gold watch and sweat stains under his armpits entered the bathroom and approached one of the urinals. It was Raul’s boss, and though Raul was standing right in front of him, he did not acknowledge Raul... Furthermore, he had such little care for Raul’s presence that as he stood at the urinal, he passed gas, twice. Upon noticing the immaculately clean ground beneath his feet, he whipped his pecker to the side and shot a stream of urine right down the wall. As the urine began to form a small pool on the floor, he turned his head and acknowledged Raul…</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, exactly… because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails—she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers—the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap… their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.”
			The Master paused for a beat.
			“Are we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?”
			The flock nodded. 
			The Master continued.
			“Twenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, “Come, it’s time you show me how to dance.” Notice the way this man Moves—fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature—vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure—and the ‘proving’—on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old ‘man impresses woman’ adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.”
			The Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.
			"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist—no hesitation, no fear—and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor… alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it… for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself—whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who’s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. ‘Take me, you wild stallion,’ she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye… the soft glow of her skin… ‘It is time,’ he says to himself. So the man—’’
			A lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically— 
			“Sir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I’m sure you understand Master!” 
			The Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. 
			“Which one of these men next to you is erect?” howled The Master.
			“It is I, Master.” murmured a soft voice. 
			The man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,
			“If any consolation, sir… gentleman… I don’t believe it is a gay erection… it is just that Master’s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual… he captured my emotions and I apologize,” he said softly.
			The Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. 
			“Apologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here… Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings… we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or… purely mechanical,” the Master said calmly. 
			The Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. 
			“You may move your seat... six inches closer to him.” 
			“Sir?” gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. 
			“You heard me… his little erection is not going to harm you… you said where you’re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,” quipped the Master. 
			“Sir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!” said the man, now on the verge of tears.
 			“Then leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!” 
			The Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.
			“Let us proceed… where did we leave off?” said the Master. 
			“Master, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels… dare I say… sinister… or Machiavellian,” a man replied.
			“What you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself… do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man… You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.”
			“But Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?” objected the man.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Master speak to us of the Process… in real life, how one begins this transformation,” said one of devout men. 
			“Before you splash one drop of shitty cologne on your neck or step one toe towards the Path of the Pimp... you must know the reality. You must know that in this moment, you and every man around you is only flirting with an idea, finger-blasting a beautiful fantasy. Like all the greatest things on the journey of life, it will take every drop of blood in your veins, every bead of sweat your skin can muster, for the unlikely chance at Pimpdom. The Path of the Pimp will take much work—it will take pain, a hell-storm of discomfort and embarrassment... Look at the man beside you, now look around the room…”
			The Master paused for a moment as the men surveyed those around them. He continued,
			“Now think back to the assembly of hemorrhoidal lumps who scampered out of here and rushed home to their infernos of emptiness before the show even began... and hear the Truth: In this moment, you think I am talking to you, that I am here for you, and that this room is some sort of mystical fraternity of rejects that are off to slay the dragon together. You imagine us meeting up a few years down the line, drinking cocktails and eating chicken fingers, busting each other's chops, and sharing nude screenshots of beautiful women in compromising positions… Yet again, you have fallen for the Fairy Tale and deceived yourself. The truth is, I am here today, right now, in this very fucking moment speaking to One man. It is he, and only he that I am speaking to. It is he, and only he, that has the chance to walk the Path of the Pimp. The rest of you are nothing more than extras cast for an hourly rate to fill his story with color and motion. So I ask you now, in your heart of hearts: are you He? If not, I am promising you this endeavor is not only a waste of your time, but will cause more pain and discomfort.”
			Twelve men got up and left the room. The remaining men got up and filled their seats closer to the Master. Raul, Gregory, and the chubby man with the lisp sat front and center. Judas, the lone wolf, refused to yield to the Master and stayed put in his seat, just close enough to lob his grenades, but far enough to feel untouchable.
			The air of camaraderie was gone. The feeling of Simp fellowship and Beta brotherhood, liquidated. For every man now Understood that if by the grace of the Almighty Pimp it was his mission, he would be going alone... 
			“Master I don’t presume you will tell us which man here is He, but may I ask if you think there is any hope for me in particular? Could you imagine me ever becoming even the lowliest of Pimps with a generous effort? I work many hours of the week, sir, but I am determined to have my pie.” 
			The Master laughed hysterically. He laughed so hard he fell backwards out of his upright posture and was laid flat on the ground. It took him a full minute to compose himself. The room was silent again, and while still laid out flat on his back, the Master spoke in a soft and sympathetic tone. 
			“Kapul, if my opinion is what you seek... I could not imagine you fucking a dead bird in a bush, let alone a woman. You’re a computer technician… a computer tech-nish-an... and nothing more. You were born to chip away at motherboards and untangle snake pits of electronic cords. You are weak, your mustache, repulsive… Your little hands equipped to your body for no other reason than to place bottles of discount lotion up by the register, your eyes, only placed in your skull to scan obscure pornography until the hour when night meets day. There is no hope for you. No hope at all. It gives me no pleasure to say this, Kapul… You are dismissed.”
 			And with his words, a different type of silence fell on the room of men. A silence so sad and empty it was as if the world itself stopped spinning to pay its respect to the complete annihilation of a human soul. Gregory sat there like a stone, the blood from his face and what remained of his erection drained down into his little feet. The hairs of his mustache curled inwards, as if the last drops of life and sweat had been snuffed out of them. They had given it everything they had, trying to convince the world that together they were a real mustache, but the time had come when they could no longer even fool themselves. 	For Gregory and the Mini Mustache, the voyage to the ‘Land of a Thousand Yearning Pussys and Maybe a Good Wife,’ was over. 
			“Go on now little Indian man! Surely there are some other gay little Indians you can seduce at the local curry hole! The rest of us want to hear what other nonsense this ‘Master’ has in store!” Judas snipped. 
			Gregory began to rise to his feet but a swift and strong arm jerked him back down.				“Who are these men to tell you your fate? If the Master’s words are Truth, then it is you— and you alone— who decides what Awaits you. Do not fail yourself, Kapul,” Raul whispered with an unusual conviction. 
			There was a gleam in Gregory’s left eye, and then a gleam in the right. He leaned into Raul, paused for a beat, and whispered back:
			“For you my brother in pussy, anti-virus scan… any time… free of charge.”
 			Gregory shot a wink at Raul, turned to the Master, who was still laid out on the floor, and shouted.
			“But Master you made no mention of my tongue! And I am only left to assume it is because you fear the tsunami it could unleash in between the thighs of the woman you love most… ‘Yes Kapul, yes,’ she says.. ‘I can’t wait a minute longer Kapul.. Pound these thick cheeks with that Anaconda, Kapul.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“She is not the enemy. She is just like me!” Shouted the men devoted men. 
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” yelled The Master.
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” chanted the choir. 
			“She shits and she does not always wash!”
			“She shits and she does not always wash!” they roared! 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“Very good,” said the Master. 
			“Hold tight to the mantra, men! The mantra is all we need!” shouted the chubby man with the lisp.
 			The Master threw his hand up in the air to halt the blossoming of a false notion.
			“No! For this is just the beginning! This is only one mantra, one practice, one compartment of the Mind. We will not stop here… We must eliminate not just the Web of the Woman, but every web you have ever spun!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">Exactly twenty two minutes later the Master reemerged onto the stage. This time doing a little sashay to the center. He sat back down in lotus position, rubbed his hands together and spoke with a mischievous grin. 
			“The Master takes his medicine, and relieves himself and twenty men disappear? Tsk Tsk.. It is not their time. And it may not be yours either, but know that just by still being seated, Here... in this moment... there is something Alive and Aware in you. For you are learning to see through the simple deceptions and tests of the world, and you are operating with stillness and patience. It is these characteristics that make the Pimp so smooth, so crafty, so capable...” 
			“Master speak more to of us of stillness and patience,” said Raul.
			“Stillness, patience.. these are qualities of a man moving beyond the Mechanical Mind who realizes in the physical sense, there is nowhere Here to go.. no reason to race past the cars on the street only to sit next to them at the red light a mile ahead. Now let’s speak on these qualities in regard to your relations with the woman. The average man receives a message from a woman he is conversing with, and what does he do? First, he thinks to himself ‘I have seen enough YouTube videos to know I must wait a bit before I respond, as I would not want to come across as needy.’ Six minutes in and the Fear starts to knock at his chest, ‘but if I wait any longer, maybe another man may snatch her attention.’ Approximately eight minutes after receiving her message, he responds with some half-witted tease that has no Magic or direction, for he has no idea where he is even taking this woman. The slightly stronger man, he responds in seventeen minutes. His message has a semblance of direction and Magic, and is just enough to warrant another casual response as she continues to test the water with the most base level of curiosity and bask in the validation of his attention. But what about the Pimp? Where is the Pimp in all of this and what the hell is he up to?”
			“He’s going to pound town on the triplets he met at the Walgreens! Ain’t he Master?” hooted the pudgy man. 
			The master dismissed the man’s juvenile remark with a wave of his hand.
			“The pimp is busy slaying the real dragon. He doesn’t even see her message until the next day. When he does, he reads it—along with seven other messages from similar women—and begins to scan for the woman that has a high level of interest, and knows how to Dance.. the one who is alive and present, and returns Magic with Magic. But then… there is a ring at the doorbell, so he drops the phone and the women and runs to the door. On his step is a mysterious package.. the one he has been anticipating! So he takes the package and scurries down into his basement... In the corner of the basement is a make-shift laboratory with shelves full of strange chemicals and glass beakers. The man rips open the package, throws on his goggles and shouts, ‘Pfizer said it couldn’t be done! Moderna said it was light years away! But nay! One man discovered the elixir in his basement! The first and only true cure for Swamp Ass is on its way!’ He stays entranced in his chemistry for the next four days straight, and emerges with a smile on his face, for he has made another inch of progress on the thousand mile journey. ‘My my what a victory.. I could really go for a cold gatorade and a recharge!’ he says to himself.”
			The Master arched his head back and simulated big gulps from a bottle. He wiped his head and continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>
