                <p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, exactly… because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails—she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers—the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap… their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.”
			The Master paused for a beat.
			“Are we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?”
			The flock nodded. 
			The Master continued.
			“Twenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, “Come, it’s time you show me how to dance.” Notice the way this man Moves—fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature—vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure—and the ‘proving’—on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old ‘man impresses woman’ adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.”
			The Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.
			"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist—no hesitation, no fear—and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor… alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it… for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself—whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who’s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. ‘Take me, you wild stallion,’ she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye… the soft glow of her skin… ‘It is time,’ he says to himself. So the man—’’
			A lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically— 
			“Sir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I’m sure you understand Master!” 
			The Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. 
			“Which one of these men next to you is erect?” howled The Master.
			“It is I, Master.” murmured a soft voice. 
			The man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,
			“If any consolation, sir… gentleman… I don’t believe it is a gay erection… it is just that Master’s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual… he captured my emotions and I apologize,” he said softly.
			The Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. 
			“Apologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here… Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings… we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or… purely mechanical,” the Master said calmly. 
			The Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. 
			“You may move your seat... six inches closer to him.” 
			“Sir?” gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. 
			“You heard me… his little erection is not going to harm you… you said where you’re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,” quipped the Master. 
			“Sir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!” said the man, now on the verge of tears.
 			“Then leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!” 
			The Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.
			“Let us proceed… where did we leave off?” said the Master. 
			“Master, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels… dare I say… sinister… or Machiavellian,” a man replied.
			“What you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself… do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man… You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.”
			“But Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?” objected the man.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The Master stood and began to walk elegantly from one side of the stage to the other as he spoke.
			“Right now in this very moment there are millions of men all over the world shouting ‘that fucking savage bitch! How could she?!’ Oh the chumps, if they had any Understanding of Reality, they would be thanking the woman for leaving, as there are two main ways a woman exits a man’s life against his wishings, and both are a gift to the man. The first way is if the woman was no good, and did something unforgivable… She blew his cousin or lied about her entire past… in which case he thanks her for taking out the trash and freeing him from her depravity. The second way, the more tragic of the two, is when she leaves because the man is weak or has moved into his feminine and her attraction disintegrates to nothingness… and begrudgingly, he must thank her for shining a light on this weakness and the chinks in his armor. For the pain inflicted by her exit serves as a baptism by fire and inspires a growth in him. This is how the Aware man deals with these scenarios. Unfortunately, for the majority of men, still anchored in their Mechanical Minds, they blame her and the world and fall further into the abyss of impotence and lifelessness. It is for this reason that the average disgruntled man sees the woman as the enemy, as his adversary. He has no awareness that her role in his narrative is to aid the blossoming of the true Power in him, by any means necessary. He makes getting the woman and keeping her his mission, he becomes reactive and emotional, he moves fully into his Feminine, and this repels her.” 
			The Master stopped his pacing and turned to the men. He stared straight out at them and spoke earnestly.
			“The truth is that a woman does not want to be man’s Mission, she does not want to be the center of his universe, or the reason he gets out of bed in the morning... She may say it is so, but Understand, it is never, ever so.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The metal chairs screeched in agony as the men pushed them aside and dove to the floor. 	Raul’s head hit the musky floor, inches from Gregory’s. He couldn’t help but notice the thousand microscopic beads of sweat sliding down Gregory’s mini mustache. 
			“Do you think… think this may be… a test, brother?” Gregory whispered as soft as a mouse. 
			“A test! Did you see the Fear in Master’s eyes? These are Federal Agents, Gregory! This is no theatre,” Raul hissed back. 
			Gregory squeezed his eyes shut and began to pant. The armed men had surrounded them now, their rifles aimed to kill. 
			There were six armed men on stage surrounding the Master. Two of the men grabbed the Master’s arms from behind with violent force, slamming cuffs on his wrists. The Master wailed in agony.  The leader of the Fed team knelt down in front of the Master and snarled,</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">As Raul stood to his feet he had a great realization: this moment had nothing to do with the Master, the men, the agents, or the Law. The film playing out before his eyes was his own creation, and the scene at hand an opportunity he had created to prove himself to Himself. And with that great realization something cracked in his mind, and for the first time in many years he felt Alive again. He could feel the blood in his veins and swelling of his testicles as he stared the Head Fed right in the eye... 
			“This man has done no evil! Especially not on behalf of the woman! For he has only taught of what her soul truly yearns, and for that which our own souls yearn as well! I stand by everything that has taken place here today!” Raul shouted.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>
