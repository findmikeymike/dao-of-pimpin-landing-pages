<p class="student">Master, I've been struggling with masculinity. Can you share your wisdom on this?</p>
<p class="master">“Yes, so there is some passion there, some curiosity… Some juice to the endeavor beyond the pay… You want to feed your fellow man, and the focus and essence of what you do is in the Creation and giving of something of substance to the world. Then by god, make the best fucking sandwiches the world has ever tasted! Step in that shop every day with the mindset that there is the possibility of the Unknown happening… create a space for the magic and step into it! No preconceived notions, no mental scripts or limitations! You love sauces, oh?!”
			“I fucking love them sir. A good sauce is like a good woman. Hard to find and in limited supply,” replied the pudgy adept.
			“Then stay an hour late every day for an entire year, mixing the sauces and rubs in different combinations and proportions until you have stumbled on a sauce like no other! A sauce so zesty and delicious it sends a shiver down the spine! Toss and turn in your bed in the late hours of the night deliberating on the best name for your sauce and how you are going to deliver it to every tongue on Earth! Make the most beautiful sandwich you have ever made, lather it with your Magic Sauce and present it to your boss… and when he takes that first bite, and his eyes roll back into his head in ecstasy, you tell him, “My special sauce sir, The Magic Sauce! I have spent a year on this and I would love your blessing in adding it to the menu!” And how will he respond?”
			“He’ll love it! He’ll say it’s genius!” shouted the man excitedly.
			“No! He will not! For his Mechanical Mind will tell him that your sauce may steal his thunder, and encroach on his power over the shop! So what will you say to him?”
			“I will say but sir—’’
			“You will say nothing to him! To bloody hell with him! He will not stop the Sauce! And so you offer it to customers when he is not there… and soon enough when everyone in that sandwich shop is lining up for your goddamn sauce and the big man gets hip to the jig and fires your ass, you smile to yourself knowing that your first set-back, the first test of your Will, means you are on the right track. So you press on… you take your earnings and buy the ingredients in bulk, and start concocting it at home… until your entire refrigerator is stocked with ‘The Magic Sauce.’ You go door to door, giving samples to people and selling your sauce… And soon enough folks are emailing the local paper about the young guy selling his sauce door to door, and the paper writes an article… the local market asks you if they can sell your sauce… and now, like an alchemist, you have transformed a mundane job and life in the sandwich shop into something More, into a Mission! And with each hurdle and each mini victory, your heart will sing and your mind will start looking at all the impossibles as Possible. You will start to see your life and destiny through a new lens. This is what puts blood in a man’s veins and a shine in his eyes. Is this a pursuit you are Ready for my boy?”</p>
