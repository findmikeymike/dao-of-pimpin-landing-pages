                <p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“We are gathered here today to solve a riddle as old as time. You can thank Adam— for when he first slid his crooked finger into the soft, warm slit of Eve, he set in motion the Eternal Conundrum of Man and a millennia of madness.. You have ensnared yourself in the Trap of all traps, and yet you have no idea of your own captivity. You came today with childish questions of pussy-piping and pick up lines, and it’s my lone hope that when you leave today, you will leave with something else entirely… And it will not be answer you came looking for. In fact, it will be a question.. The One Real Question… Neither I, nor Saint Peter himself has the answer for you. For it was you, and only you that created this mess, and it is you and only you who has the power to see your way out of it…” 
			A middle aged Pakistani man with a pitiful mustache raised his hand. Before being addressed, and with his hand still raised awkwardly, he rose and spoke in a thick Indian accent.
			“But sir, I did not pay to hear philosophical musings. I was told you could teach me how to fuck on college girls and find a good wife.”
			“Fuck on college girls you may Kapul, find a wife you may… but if and only if you come to Understand the Truth… women, dating, fucking… these are a symptom, a mere by-product of Pimping. They are not the Mission. They are the ice cold cups of Gatorade waiting for you at the pit-stops on the marathon of life… on the real Mission at hand… If it is only sex with beautiful women you desire Kapul, then find the Master of Commerce, take a seminar, make yourself a small fortune, and go to a whore house… but I challenge you to ask yourself after the first load you spew, if that was ‘It,’ if that pop was the truest desire of your heart. For the True Desire of man never falters or retreats. It is always there, calling…”
			“But what could possibly be better than some good snatch Master?!” interjected the Indian man. The other men agreed. 
			“You are a mouse in a closet looking for cheese. A mouse with no awareness to the vastness of the house you live in. A mouse that could never even fathom a journey to the other side of the neighborhood. A mouse that could never understand the fact that the neighborhood is but a mouse to the city, the city a mouse to the nation, and the nation a mouse to Earth. Are you such a fool that you spent 4,000 dollars and flew from India to learn of the cheese in the closet? Lower your arm. Sit down.”
			“Sir… I was born in Georgia,” muttered the Pakistani man.
			“I enjoy cheese. Greatly, sir. My uncle owns a pizza parlor in Brooklyn. So you will teach us nothing of women? Please teach us of women, Master,” interjected a man who wanted to Believe.
			“I will teach you about women and the simple form of pimping as you know it to be, as conquering The Woman is the central battle in all of your narratives, and the greatest hurdle to your evolution. Her and her sweet titties and her sharp tongue, they are the center of your Universe. She sends fear up your spine, and electricity through your little dick. She makes your voice shake, and your knees weak. She takes one look at another man, and crushes your fragile soul. She must be conquered…”
			The men perked up, ready to receive and savor every word of esoteric wisdom the Master had in store.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Now let us face the beast: Fear… There is natural fear, the healthy fear that was programmed into the hardware of your mind at birth to keep you alive... this  fear is not the problem. The problem lies in the conditioned fear and aversions, the ones you have gathered along the journey that are irrational, and serve you in no way. The majority of these fears are of a social nature, and have to do with your acceptance in the tribe. There was a time when these fears served a purpose for man, as being cast out of the tribe meant certain death in the wild, but both man and the world alike have evolved. A man can survive and thrive on his own without the approval of the family, friends, and society around him. In many ways, his willingness to leave ‘The Group' is the beginning of his journey to his highest self, the true Pimp in him. Look at the life of any Christ or Buddha or great rockstar and you will see… they did not walk in line with society, they vowed for no man or woman’s approval… the Magic of their lives and stories was in opposition to these things.”
 			“Master, tell us more of dealing with these fears and entanglements,” exclaimed Gregory. 
			“First, we understand the difference between fear and aversion. Both must be conquered on the path to Pimpdom. The fear is what makes your heart race and hands shake. Aversions are the things that make you less comfortable in life and bring an unpleasantness to your mind. To unwrite these softwares of fear and aversion you have installed in the Mind, we first be conscious of them. For each of you has had different experiences and spun different webs… different Imprints… and accordingly, there will be different paths to their undoing. Let’s start with you, snacker with the lisp, tell me something that makes your skin crawl, something that strikes no fear in you, but you avoid like the plague.”
			“I hate being wet in clothing, sir. Especially jeans… I do not leave the house when it’s raining past a drizzle.” 
			“Well good gracious, imagine that… a grown man refusing to be involved with life and the world because he does not want to get a little wet. How much Magic and opportunity he may have missed lingering just beyond the rain… It was the Log Flume I presume?” 
			“Good god, Master? How—how could you have known? Yes, it was indeed the Log Flume. I remember being ten years old at the waterpark and the woman guaranteeing me if I sat in the back I would not take on any water… at worst a light mist. I was soaked to the bone and my breasts and rolls protruded from my t-shirt and the other children called me the Flume Whale for nearly a year!” 
			“And as the pain and embarrassment of such an archetypal scene was branded with a hot iron into the Mind, the Web began to spin… the fear left a trail… a present day aversion… and a very silly thing that holds you back in life. It will only continue to hinder you so we must destroy it at once! I want you to put on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt every single day for the next month and have your neighbor dowse you with a hose before you leave your house. I mean drenched and dripping to the damn bone. When you are soaked to the bone, I want you to verbally say aloud, ‘Out with all remnants and noise of the past, for they are but a dream. I am baptized in these waters and made clean again.’ Then go about your business as usual... The first few days you will think of nothing but your discomfort, but with each passing day, you will become used to it. Your mind will accept that you are wet and surrender its useless fight... and day by day the imprint in your mind will begin to evaporate, hell you may even begin to enjoy the cool sensation it brings and how alert you have become. You may start enjoying it so goddamn much you have to pay your neighbor a monthly salary to hose you down in your clothes everyday...” 
			“Master I have no relation with my neighbors.” 
			“Then it will be one hell of an ice breaker... ‘Hello my good man, would you mind spraying me with your fucking hose?’ What sane man could refuse such good fun?”
			“But Master if—”
			The pudgy man tried to interject but was steamrolled by the impassioned Master.
			“After you have completed this torrential month, I want you to repeat the process, but this time, I want you out in the world shirtless. Let those titties swing and that belly shake. For we must get to the root of this web, right down to the fear that birthed it.”
			The pudgy man with the lisp opened his mouth to respond but the Master pressed on.
			“Now let us move on to someone else. You there... little ginger man with the large nose, hiding his head… yes, you… what is that haunts your dreams?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The metal chairs screeched in agony as the men pushed them aside and dove to the floor. 	Raul’s head hit the musky floor, inches from Gregory’s. He couldn’t help but notice the thousand microscopic beads of sweat sliding down Gregory’s mini mustache. 
			“Do you think… think this may be… a test, brother?” Gregory whispered as soft as a mouse. 
			“A test! Did you see the Fear in Master’s eyes? These are Federal Agents, Gregory! This is no theatre,” Raul hissed back. 
			Gregory squeezed his eyes shut and began to pant. The armed men had surrounded them now, their rifles aimed to kill. 
			There were six armed men on stage surrounding the Master. Two of the men grabbed the Master’s arms from behind with violent force, slamming cuffs on his wrists. The Master wailed in agony.  The leader of the Fed team knelt down in front of the Master and snarled,</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“You can tell that to the judge,” the Head Fed snipped back. He turned to the group of men. 
			“Now as for you gentlemen… you too, have broken many serious new laws that come with stiff penalties and serious jail time. These laws include: One— Payment for Information Endangering Women… Two— Actively pursuing and engaging with a known Pimp… Three— Pursuing Pimpdom… Now I will present you with two options. You may plead negligence based on the newness of this law, verbally rebuke Pimpdom and your activities here today, and agree to reveal the financial details and all payments made to Mr. Sammy Davis Jr., to be used against in the court of law… or you can face the Law yourself, and continue your pursuits with Mr. Davis behind cold, metal bars for decades to come. I will now ask that the compliers of my first request come stand over here on the left side of the room with our agents.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory entered the Tavern with an energy and ease they had never stepped into anywhere before…. like two young warriors who had just put their lives on the line for the first time and claimed victory in a fierce battle. Only an hour ago they’d been staring down a life behind bars... what was there to fear? Who or what could possibly Move them after a day like today? 
			As they approached the bar, a young hottie with tattoos grabbed Gregory’s arm. 
			“Hey daddy… how about a beer for the pretty lady? Hm? Buy me a beer?” yapped the hottie with an air of entitlement and expectation. 
			“Would you like my ATM number too?” Gregory replied in a calm, careless tone. 
			The girl was a bit taken aback. It was not what she expected to hear come out of this small Indian man’s mouth. 
			“Well, if you give me your ATM number, I could take you to get a haircut and maybe even get that dirty little mustache shaved off,” she challenged.</p>
