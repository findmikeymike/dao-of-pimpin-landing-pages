                <p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“You missed a spot,” he snarled. 
			Raul’s blood began to boil. He had a fleeting vision of cracking the man over the head with the handle of his mop and flushing his remains down the toilet. It was not the first time he had been treated with such disrespect and contempt by his boss, but it was the most brash, and as infuriated as he was in the moment, there was a part of him that felt it was deserved. You are thirty-eight years old Raul! And this is how you spend your precious life? Cleaning toilets and replacing light bulbs for barbarians! Slaving away for pennies! It’s been twenty years now, Raul! Get it together!
			There was a more hopeful time in Raul’s life when he did have a Dream. He had grand and lucid visions of his very own janitorial company, ‘Delgado’s Diligent Cleaning.’ The most esteemed and prestigious cleaning service in all of Little Rock. Raul could see in vivid, crystallized color a satellite view of his vans crawling on every corner of the city. He saw people at stop lights giving the thumbs up to his workers and the occasional woman flashing her bosoms in the front yard as he passed in the ‘Boss Van’. He saw warm, pink suds soaking into terminally ill carpet, and a time-lapse of their resuscitations to a youthful vigor. 
			But as the gears of the galaxy churned on, and the years passed, and the hell-raising women crept in the cracks of his sad life to tap the last of his blood, the color and clarity of Raul’s visions faded away, leaving behind only the carcass of a Dream.. a pile of bones and a few shreds of dried meat. He needed a win in life, something… anything... to give him a bit of faith and keep him Going. 
			Raul pulled out of the Lake Crest parking lot and  floored it. His ’87 Volvo shrieked and wailed as it barreled down the open road, rattling maniacally as it surged to its top speed. The odometer read thirty-eight miles per hour. With the motel and all of its horror finally out of sight, Raul dug into his pocket, pulled out the mystical notecard, and placed it in his lap. He gently stroked the card with his thumb, over and over, as if to ensure its secrets would not escape. The cars behind him on the single lane road beeped in agony, just as they always did. “Forget them, Raul! Stay focused… You may just be holding the ticket to a new life, Raul!” he thought to himself. In four short days, he would have his answer.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, exactly… because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails—she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers—the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap… their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.”
			The Master paused for a beat.
			“Are we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?”
			The flock nodded. 
			The Master continued.
			“Twenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, “Come, it’s time you show me how to dance.” Notice the way this man Moves—fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature—vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure—and the ‘proving’—on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old ‘man impresses woman’ adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.”
			The Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.
			"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist—no hesitation, no fear—and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor… alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it… for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself—whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who’s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. ‘Take me, you wild stallion,’ she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye… the soft glow of her skin… ‘It is time,’ he says to himself. So the man—’’
			A lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically— 
			“Sir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I’m sure you understand Master!” 
			The Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. 
			“Which one of these men next to you is erect?” howled The Master.
			“It is I, Master.” murmured a soft voice. 
			The man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,
			“If any consolation, sir… gentleman… I don’t believe it is a gay erection… it is just that Master’s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual… he captured my emotions and I apologize,” he said softly.
			The Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. 
			“Apologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here… Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings… we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or… purely mechanical,” the Master said calmly. 
			The Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. 
			“You may move your seat... six inches closer to him.” 
			“Sir?” gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. 
			“You heard me… his little erection is not going to harm you… you said where you’re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,” quipped the Master. 
			“Sir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!” said the man, now on the verge of tears.
 			“Then leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!” 
			The Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.
			“Let us proceed… where did we leave off?” said the Master. 
			“Master, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels… dare I say… sinister… or Machiavellian,” a man replied.
			“What you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself… do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man… You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.”
			“But Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?” objected the man.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“This... sir.” said the timid ginger man with a tremble. 
			“This… this… what? Speak up!” said the Master. 
			“To… to… be put… on the spot… to speak pu… publicly.” he stammered. 
			“Ah! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly… and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me… Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night… the shame, the guilt… you cannot run from it… it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go ‘on the spot’ more… and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root… and like a hellish weed, it will rear it’s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender… Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?”
			The little ginger man’s face turned blood red. 
			“Ginger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre… tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.” 
			The little ginger man made an ‘Okay’ gesture with his hand and nodded his head. 
			“Say it out loud! Let us hear your voice!”
			“Okay,” said the man sheepishly.
			“We do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!” howled the Master.
			“OKAY,” the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Speak to us more of… the… Tests along the way, Master. It seems as if… as if… all of life itself is just one Test… after… another..” said the ginger man with a waver in his voice.
			“As I said before, the Tests of life, of the woman.. they are not the enemy. They are not a force of evil. They are your friend. They are there to aid and propel your evolution. Like everything else we have discussed today, the first step is to recognize and be conscious of the tests. Let’s go back to the woman, as her tests are relentless and a metaphor for all of life tests. The woman’s tests are a constant and endless check on man as to whether he is centered in himself and his Mission. The majority of you are here because you fail the very first test of the woman, and that is having a basic conviction in yourself. Her entire evolution has wired her to smell your bullshit from a mile away, as her evolutionary survival depended on it. You approach her and she senses your fear and incongruence, she senses you have no direction in your step, and her subconscious mind sounds the alarm: ‘He is afraid and shook by a 140-pound girl that wishes him no harm.. what will the world do to him?!’ And she is right!”
			The Master was in the Zone. The pace of his speech picked up as he continued.
			“Now let’s say you have some semblance of conviction and competence and you have begun dating a woman for a few months, and she says to you ‘I think its silly your refrigerator is full of sauces and find it a bit embarrassing to see you going door to door like a peasant trying hustle your sauce. My father said he would give you a real job.’ What does the average man do? He quits, in fear he may lose her... and on the surface she is happy, because here is a man that was so afraid to lose her, he gave up on The Mission. She feels validated in her Womanly Woo and influence, but beneath the surface, deep in her soul she is repulsed, and her attraction withers. The man was swayed from his own Will and Path by an outside opinion and a few unpleasant comments… How many of you have been this man? How many of you are still He?”
			Raul was the first to raise his hand. He had always been this man, oblivious to the glaringly obvious. His newfound clarity on a world once shrouded in mystery and chaos was truly emancipating. 
			The Master signaled for the men to put down their hands as he continued the teaching.
			“Know that she will plunder you with a barrage of trivial tests too, from the ‘I don’t like this song. Change it,’ to the ‘You would never really vote for that man, would you?’ All these can be translated into the same question ‘Are you a Pimp or a bitch? Are you about that life or are you not?’ And the correct answer is always your Truth, your Will, what you Want for Yourself... no matter how offended or disgruntled it may make her on the surface, know that on a deeper level you sticking to your guns and standing where you Choose to stand is what draws her closer and makes her gain trust in you as a man. And as for the true Pimp…”
			The Master smiled a devious smile.
			“The true Pimp who understands all of this knows how to flip the script on her entirely. He is on a date with a woman and starts deploying his own tests and challenges before she even has a chance to set the age old ‘I’m the woman and you are here to impress me… now here’s your first test’ frame. She scrambles as her Mechanical Mind is not used to being in such a peculiar and compromising position. He is tickled to see the true simp come out in her.. ‘No, no!’ she says, ‘I only went to see Maroon 5 because my friend had bought the tickets!’ The pimp chuckles in amusement and pokes at her, ‘Riiiiiight.. Check please!” 
			“Brilliant, sir! But… how on Earth is the woman so damn crafty? How many hours a day does she scheme on the man?” said a spirited young man.
			The Master had a good laugh at this. 
			“No, no… the vast majority of the time, a woman’s test are not consciously concocted. She is not off in some dark alley trading ‘catch the man’ tests with other women… The testing is wired and of an evolutionary nature. It is a survival mechanism of her subconscious mind to weed out the simps and weaklings from the true Pimps... and it is for this reason that her tests are not always easy to recognize... as you will not sense any level of deception or fuckery in the delivery of her tests… but know that until you have proved unwavering conviction in yourself and your Path, her tests, and the world’s tests, will not cease. Again, we must not see this is a burden, but a gift and service to keep you on your toes and steadfast on the Mission. Know that just like the undertaking of the Mission, we are not out to pass a woman’s tests to keep the woman or please the woman, we pass these tests for ourselves, for our own evolution. Her attraction is just a symptom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">Raul the Pimp, 		Let the contents of this envelope serve you on 
	The Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>
