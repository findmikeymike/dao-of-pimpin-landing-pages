                <p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">That afternoon, as Raul mopped the scum off the floor of the Lake Crest Motel’s bathroom, his mind spun in every direction. He pawed at his eyes, but the strange blue tint cast over his world would not wane. 
			A grossly overweight man with a tacky gold watch and sweat stains under his armpits entered the bathroom and approached one of the urinals. It was Raul’s boss, and though Raul was standing right in front of him, he did not acknowledge Raul... Furthermore, he had such little care for Raul’s presence that as he stood at the urinal, he passed gas, twice. Upon noticing the immaculately clean ground beneath his feet, he whipped his pecker to the side and shot a stream of urine right down the wall. As the urine began to form a small pool on the floor, he turned his head and acknowledged Raul…</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Say one did want to win her back? How should he go about it? I’m not speaking of this woman, just in general.” 
			“Oh not this woman?! Ha! Now you think you are deceiving me—and the other men around you—but you are only deceiving and confusing Yourself ... and this is the great trap of Dishonesty. A man on the Path must do all he can to be clear, open, honest, and Real with himself and others—as tough as it may be at times. For in every act of deception a seed of its own Undoing is planted. No lie will go unaccounted for. In regard to ‘winning’ the woman back, what kind of prize is spoiled milk? You ‘win’ her back… and what? You think this woman would ever have any respect and loyalty to such a cowardly man? That her behavior would magically change? Your relationship with this woman is over. Done. Thank her whatever she Revealed to you about Yourself, and move on with your life. Men spend so much of their fragile time dealing with some thing of the past, rekindling an old affair with some sub-par woman, and little do they realize they are only digging a deeper hole for themselves. They will do anything to delay the inevitable pain, and only torture themselves more.” 
			The Master paused for a beat. 
			“Keep in mind this Truth: the reason you are so stuck on her is because she is the one you encountered. There are literally millions of women on this Earth that had you met in that very same moment you met this woman, you would be just as in love with, just as broken over. Your pain and pining is because your Mechanical Mind sees a distorted Reality. You think it is about her, everything is about her, when it is really about You.”
			The Master stepped to the very front of the stage and spoke very solemnly.
			“She is only a key… a key that unlocks a space of love and beauty within Yourself. The Love, the Beauty, the Feeling… the entire journey… it is happening from Within You… A man must make and use his own key.. for if he lets the woman—or the world be his key, he will be on The Ride for eternity.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">From above the auditorium, came the humming whop-whop-whop of rotors. As the sound grew louder, it became clear—this wasn’t one helicopter, but a swarm. 
			The room was dead silent as the Master and the men listened intently. The humming swelled to a deafening blare, as if the choppers were hovering just above the roof. The anxious men looked to the Master, hoping his cool and calm Pimp demeanor would quell their anxiety, but for the first time, they saw in him The Fear… 
			“Aw shit…” whispered the Master in a wavy, desperation. 
			His chest started to beat like a drum, rising and falling with increasing speed. 
			Watching the Master surrender to the fear, the men spiraled into silent hysteria, and the symphony of racing hearts and shaky breathes resumed. 
			Over one of the helicopter’s megaphones a crisp and piercing voice commanded:
			“THIS IS THE FEDERAL POLICE OF JUSTICE. DO NOT MOVE A MUSCLE.”
			The men gasped and the symphony hit its crescendo—ten tactical ropes dropped from the rafters above, and like spiders, heavily armed men in pink helmets and all black armor scurried down into the auditorium. 
			“GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND, NOW!” screamed one of the Feds.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">After fifty minutes, the van finally came to a halt and the doors swung open. By the bustling and busyness of the street outside it was clear they were in the downtown of a city, but anyone’s guess as to where exactly. 
			The federal agents grabbed the three men and yanked them out of the van. As they were steered into an old, brick building and prodded up a flight of stairs, the agents railed at them.
			“Move! Hurry it up, you fucking degenerates! We don’t have all day.”
			At the top of the stairs, the agents shoed them into a small, square room with plain white walls. Cameras in each corner stared down at them, poised to broadcast their images on the local late-night news as the most wicked and dangerous of men.
			The Head Fed followed the Master, Raul, and Gregory inside and shut the door behind them. In the middle of the room stood a black table and three brown envelopes, each tagged with their names. 
			“Gentlemen, inside each of these envelopes we have the official documentation and proof of each of your crimes. Now Mr. Davis won’t be going anywhere... but because I am an extremely forgiving man, I am going to give you two scoundrels one last opportunity to rebuke your crimes and agree to testify against Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.... and if you are willing to comply, you may go on your way,” the Head Fed said addressing Raul and Gregory. 
			“You heard the man. Do not be fools… my fate is already sealed, the show is over… go on your way,” said the Master.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">The Head Fed set down his gun on the table and lit a cigarette ablaze. As he exhaled a waft of smoke, he began to slow clap, and in a cool calm tone, he spoke,
			“Gentlemen… it is with the Master’s blessings I hereby announce you Pimp’s of the First Degree. Congratulations and welcome to The Path.” 
			“Now get these fucking cuffs off us…  Jesus, Buck!.. how many times have I told you not to cuff me so fucking tight.. I’m not as nimble as I used to be... I’m an old ass man!” zipped the Master. 
			“At once, Master! Just making sure you haven’t gone full simp on us! My apologies sir!” the ‘Fed’ replied as he scurried behind the Master to finagle his cuffs.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>
