                <p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Somewhere in southern Florida at 4 A.M., Raul sat in a gigantic, windowless auditorium with 1,253 other broken and helpless men. The auditorium was cold and archaic, giving the impression it hadn’t seen a lick of activity in the last twenty years. The air in the room smelled like vinegar and mildew. The floor was stained a tainted shade of yellow. The room sizzled with nervous whisperings and squeaking chairs.
			It was nearly lunch hour, and a good portion of the men had lost all faith and left in a tizzy. “What kind of goddamn master books a shit-hole like this and shows up hours late!” they thought to themselves as they skidded out of the parking lot. As for the remaining men, they clung to the last tethers of hope, and as their hope withered and the ache of abandonment began to scream in their intestines—the lights went out in the auditorium… It was pitch fucking black. The whispering seized, and a piercing silence fell on the room. The men’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a few of them noticed something moving in their periphery… and then all of them noticed… a shadowy figure limped slowly towards the center of the stage.
			A circular, almost cartoonish spotlight clicked on and standing as still as a statue in the dead center of the light was a short, crinkled black man with a round gut. The gut hung lazily over his flowing, black velvet pants. What was left of his hair was frazzled and greying. He appeared to be in his mid-70s. His eyes scanned the room, his body remained motionless.
			Soft whisperings surfaced from the silence as the men appraised the static, velvet creature. “Surely this cannot be the master?! Where is our young, toned pussy slayer?! Where is He with a cock like thunder and the triceps of a mule?” a doubter whispered.					“What a disaster his jawline! What a ruse his vitality!” another chimed in. 
			Then, like an eruption, deep bellowing laughter surged through the speakers, echoing through the auditorium. When the last trail of the Velvet Man's laughter faded, there were exactly three seconds of a deadly hush, and then, with a deep and slow Southern draw, The Master spoke… 
			“You fucking cunts, look at you all… traveling from the edges of Earth, shelling the last of your humble earnings for a chance at a little pussy. You have been scammed yet again. But take solace in knowing you have helped me greatly. My debts are paid, and my future secure. I will not waste one penny of your hard earned money. I shall spend the rest of my days traveling to exotic islands, drinking the strongest liquors, and bedding the most beautiful harlots this world has ever birthed. I appreciate every one of you. You may go now.” 
			A scrawny man with a bowl cut took to his feet.
			“How dare you! How dare you swindle us in the hour of our greatest desperation! Burn in hell you old bandit!” he screeched. His body shook like an old motor on its last mile. A tear rolled down his face. The Master wailed in amusement. 
			“God strike this old devil with Syphilis and Scabies! Make him pay! Make his last days hellfire!” howled another naysayer.
			The Master clapped joyfully along to the men’s ranting and then, in a cool and calm voice replied, 
			“Yes, yes. That’s the spirit. The Good Lord has heard your request and added it to his To-Do list. You, too, are dismissed.” 
			Raul watched as the dejected men rose to their feet, steaming and screaming as they cast their stones at the stage. He wondered for which of these men it was the final straw, the last faint glimmer of hope being  devoured by the all-consuming darkness. Surely tomorrow there would be the news: “Heartbroken Simpleton, 31, found dead in a river.” Who would be the first to take that great leap? 
			One by one, the men shuffled towards the exit, cursing under their breath at themselves and the world. Raul continued to watch the men without moving. He was nine hundred miles from home with nowhere to go, nothing left to lose. His rage was exhausted. He had no will to stand, or leave, and so, he sat.  
			Within a few short moments, a room of over a thousand men had withered to thirty seven. The Master took off his shoes, sat down on the floor in the lotus position, tapped the microphone twice, and said, 
			“Now let us begin.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“And now here you are, trying your best to pacify this sea of emotions, and win this woman’s affections back, and like the simp that you are, you waste the next six hours in a state of high anxiety, trying to find something clever to say to rekindle the fire with this woman. You’re sure you’ve got it… oh yeah. You’ve got it this time… and you hit the send… and the hands of the clock start ticking so slowly, they’re damn near going in reverse. Twenty minutes… two hours… the fear builds… eight hours… three days… and nothing. Not a word. You played out the sequence of an entire relationship with a girl you didn’t know from a hole in the ground, and the whole thing was a mirage, a head trip… You were on The Ride… from fear to love, from love to fear... And so usually you take a cold shower and chalk it up as another loss, bite down on the pain… another heartbreak in that bag you carry, a little more dead weight laid up on your spirit. But this time, this time is different, because not only were you watching it happen, you were feeling it happen, and you were beginning to Understand the Motion… the Language. And so like the crafty and stubborn and determined man that you are, the next one comes along and you flip the script. Beat for beat, you flip the fucking script. Right at the peak of the warmth and excitement, right when she sends you so many goddamn emojis you start to think the girl may have schizophrenia, right at the zenith of the Love and heat… you disappear… Nowhere to be found… And The Ride is in motion…”
			“But Master, surely the man with the classic smile and warm scent does have the advantage… You cannot tell me that wasn’t part of her attraction?” said an ambivalent man in the back.
			“I am teaching you real Magic, known and Understood by one man in ten thousand, and you’re still asking about the fellow with the classic smile and tangerine scent? Do you see what I mean when I say men miss the forest for the trees? Yes the man with the sharp smile does have an advantage. He, like you, has a false sense of the what the woman truly desires. He has been told his entire life that his beautiful face was the thing that truly spoke to the heart of a Woman, and therefore, rather conveniently, tricked himself into a conviction and confidence that allowed him to be at ease around women.”
			The Master turned and looked directly at the ambivalent man.
			 “I am not telling you that a woman does not have eyes, or can’t see a man with a perfectly symmetrical face, chiseled chest, strong arms and feel no Want. Yes, she absolutely may feel some tingle in her loins, have a visceral reaction, but I am telling you that her hither brains are taking those as signals… signals for something that she senses may lie under the surface… a man at ease with himself, a man with the power to Move her. I’m telling you that if that beefcake does not Move her emotions, and I get seven minutes alone with her in the back of some dimly lit dive bar, she will be rubbing my belly and calling me daddy in the bed of the nearest roach motel before one of you can say “But his abs!” 
			The Master shook his gut with both hands and continued.
			“Do you understand? What I am telling you is that a woman will adjust the way she Sees you to match the way that you make her feel…Listen carefully. I said a woman will adjust the way she sees you to match the way that you make here FEEL. Understand that sex appeal does not happen in the gym, it happens in the heart… in the attitude, in the energy. Take the ugliest motherfucker in this room, and if his Pimpin is tight enough, I’m telling you within twenty minutes she can be looking at him like he was the genetic spawn of Leonardo DiCaprio and Beyonce. Where’s my little Indian friend? Yes, even you Kapul.”
			“My name is not Kapul, it is Gregory, Master,” said the Indian man meekly.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>
