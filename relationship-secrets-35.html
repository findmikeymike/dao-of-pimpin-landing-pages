                <p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“You are missing the point. When a man has transformed into the Pimp, there is no way around this draw. It is natural, and inevitable. Until man has been Reborn into this higher version of himself, and while his maneuverings are still conscious and strategic, there are, however, great implications. With great power comes great responsibility… You must always be conscious she is human just like you, and to continue to intentionally Move her and keep her on a Ride when you have no real interest in her is in fact a dangerous and sadistic game. I am not here to be your ethical compass or tell you how to behave in the world, only to teach you the Truth. What you do with it is up to you…The man you want to be is your choice, and yours alone. With that said, you should understand that we are striving to move beyond the realm of maneuverings and manipulations… and the thing that were are striving to Become happens to be exactly the thing the woman yearns for. There is no conflict here… the goal is the same whether she existed or not.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“This... sir.” said the timid ginger man with a tremble. 
			“This… this… what? Speak up!” said the Master. 
			“To… to… be put… on the spot… to speak pu… publicly.” he stammered. 
			“Ah! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly… and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me… Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night… the shame, the guilt… you cannot run from it… it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go ‘on the spot’ more… and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root… and like a hellish weed, it will rear it’s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender… Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?”
			The little ginger man’s face turned blood red. 
			“Ginger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre… tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.” 
			The little ginger man made an ‘Okay’ gesture with his hand and nodded his head. 
			“Say it out loud! Let us hear your voice!”
			“Okay,” said the man sheepishly.
			“We do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!” howled the Master.
			“OKAY,” the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">Exactly twenty two minutes later the Master reemerged onto the stage. This time doing a little sashay to the center. He sat back down in lotus position, rubbed his hands together and spoke with a mischievous grin. 
			“The Master takes his medicine, and relieves himself and twenty men disappear? Tsk Tsk.. It is not their time. And it may not be yours either, but know that just by still being seated, Here... in this moment... there is something Alive and Aware in you. For you are learning to see through the simple deceptions and tests of the world, and you are operating with stillness and patience. It is these characteristics that make the Pimp so smooth, so crafty, so capable...” 
			“Master speak more to of us of stillness and patience,” said Raul.
			“Stillness, patience.. these are qualities of a man moving beyond the Mechanical Mind who realizes in the physical sense, there is nowhere Here to go.. no reason to race past the cars on the street only to sit next to them at the red light a mile ahead. Now let’s speak on these qualities in regard to your relations with the woman. The average man receives a message from a woman he is conversing with, and what does he do? First, he thinks to himself ‘I have seen enough YouTube videos to know I must wait a bit before I respond, as I would not want to come across as needy.’ Six minutes in and the Fear starts to knock at his chest, ‘but if I wait any longer, maybe another man may snatch her attention.’ Approximately eight minutes after receiving her message, he responds with some half-witted tease that has no Magic or direction, for he has no idea where he is even taking this woman. The slightly stronger man, he responds in seventeen minutes. His message has a semblance of direction and Magic, and is just enough to warrant another casual response as she continues to test the water with the most base level of curiosity and bask in the validation of his attention. But what about the Pimp? Where is the Pimp in all of this and what the hell is he up to?”
			“He’s going to pound town on the triplets he met at the Walgreens! Ain’t he Master?” hooted the pudgy man. 
			The master dismissed the man’s juvenile remark with a wave of his hand.
			“The pimp is busy slaying the real dragon. He doesn’t even see her message until the next day. When he does, he reads it—along with seven other messages from similar women—and begins to scan for the woman that has a high level of interest, and knows how to Dance.. the one who is alive and present, and returns Magic with Magic. But then… there is a ring at the doorbell, so he drops the phone and the women and runs to the door. On his step is a mysterious package.. the one he has been anticipating! So he takes the package and scurries down into his basement... In the corner of the basement is a make-shift laboratory with shelves full of strange chemicals and glass beakers. The man rips open the package, throws on his goggles and shouts, ‘Pfizer said it couldn’t be done! Moderna said it was light years away! But nay! One man discovered the elixir in his basement! The first and only true cure for Swamp Ass is on its way!’ He stays entranced in his chemistry for the next four days straight, and emerges with a smile on his face, for he has made another inch of progress on the thousand mile journey. ‘My my what a victory.. I could really go for a cold gatorade and a recharge!’ he says to himself.”
			The Master arched his head back and simulated big gulps from a bottle. He wiped his head and continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Okay? You craft sandwiches… and you say that as if it is an empty pursuit… a realm that holds no potential for any kind of evolution or magic... but let me tell you the potential Mission of man comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. It is not in the “what man does” but in the “how he does it.” Do not think that Mission means a man must start a multi-million dollar company, or win an Oscar, or reach some fantastical level of social status. You may have a man that’s truest calling in life is simply to Teach... maybe his passion is for history and he teaches a middle school class. What matters is the hunger, relentlessness, and creativity he approaches his teaching with. How far he is willing to push to be the most legendary teacher that ever walked the Earth? Let me ask you… why do you spend your life making sandwiches?” 
			“Because it pays a fair wage sir, and I get joy in seeing people eat. I love sauces and the way they can bring a sandwich to life. I put sauces on everything.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Speak to us more of… the… Tests along the way, Master. It seems as if… as if… all of life itself is just one Test… after… another..” said the ginger man with a waver in his voice.
			“As I said before, the Tests of life, of the woman.. they are not the enemy. They are not a force of evil. They are your friend. They are there to aid and propel your evolution. Like everything else we have discussed today, the first step is to recognize and be conscious of the tests. Let’s go back to the woman, as her tests are relentless and a metaphor for all of life tests. The woman’s tests are a constant and endless check on man as to whether he is centered in himself and his Mission. The majority of you are here because you fail the very first test of the woman, and that is having a basic conviction in yourself. Her entire evolution has wired her to smell your bullshit from a mile away, as her evolutionary survival depended on it. You approach her and she senses your fear and incongruence, she senses you have no direction in your step, and her subconscious mind sounds the alarm: ‘He is afraid and shook by a 140-pound girl that wishes him no harm.. what will the world do to him?!’ And she is right!”
			The Master was in the Zone. The pace of his speech picked up as he continued.
			“Now let’s say you have some semblance of conviction and competence and you have begun dating a woman for a few months, and she says to you ‘I think its silly your refrigerator is full of sauces and find it a bit embarrassing to see you going door to door like a peasant trying hustle your sauce. My father said he would give you a real job.’ What does the average man do? He quits, in fear he may lose her... and on the surface she is happy, because here is a man that was so afraid to lose her, he gave up on The Mission. She feels validated in her Womanly Woo and influence, but beneath the surface, deep in her soul she is repulsed, and her attraction withers. The man was swayed from his own Will and Path by an outside opinion and a few unpleasant comments… How many of you have been this man? How many of you are still He?”
			Raul was the first to raise his hand. He had always been this man, oblivious to the glaringly obvious. His newfound clarity on a world once shrouded in mystery and chaos was truly emancipating. 
			The Master signaled for the men to put down their hands as he continued the teaching.
			“Know that she will plunder you with a barrage of trivial tests too, from the ‘I don’t like this song. Change it,’ to the ‘You would never really vote for that man, would you?’ All these can be translated into the same question ‘Are you a Pimp or a bitch? Are you about that life or are you not?’ And the correct answer is always your Truth, your Will, what you Want for Yourself... no matter how offended or disgruntled it may make her on the surface, know that on a deeper level you sticking to your guns and standing where you Choose to stand is what draws her closer and makes her gain trust in you as a man. And as for the true Pimp…”
			The Master smiled a devious smile.
			“The true Pimp who understands all of this knows how to flip the script on her entirely. He is on a date with a woman and starts deploying his own tests and challenges before she even has a chance to set the age old ‘I’m the woman and you are here to impress me… now here’s your first test’ frame. She scrambles as her Mechanical Mind is not used to being in such a peculiar and compromising position. He is tickled to see the true simp come out in her.. ‘No, no!’ she says, ‘I only went to see Maroon 5 because my friend had bought the tickets!’ The pimp chuckles in amusement and pokes at her, ‘Riiiiiight.. Check please!” 
			“Brilliant, sir! But… how on Earth is the woman so damn crafty? How many hours a day does she scheme on the man?” said a spirited young man.
			The Master had a good laugh at this. 
			“No, no… the vast majority of the time, a woman’s test are not consciously concocted. She is not off in some dark alley trading ‘catch the man’ tests with other women… The testing is wired and of an evolutionary nature. It is a survival mechanism of her subconscious mind to weed out the simps and weaklings from the true Pimps... and it is for this reason that her tests are not always easy to recognize... as you will not sense any level of deception or fuckery in the delivery of her tests… but know that until you have proved unwavering conviction in yourself and your Path, her tests, and the world’s tests, will not cease. Again, we must not see this is a burden, but a gift and service to keep you on your toes and steadfast on the Mission. Know that just like the undertaking of the Mission, we are not out to pass a woman’s tests to keep the woman or please the woman, we pass these tests for ourselves, for our own evolution. Her attraction is just a symptom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“Say one did want to win her back? How should he go about it? I’m not speaking of this woman, just in general.” 
			“Oh not this woman?! Ha! Now you think you are deceiving me—and the other men around you—but you are only deceiving and confusing Yourself ... and this is the great trap of Dishonesty. A man on the Path must do all he can to be clear, open, honest, and Real with himself and others—as tough as it may be at times. For in every act of deception a seed of its own Undoing is planted. No lie will go unaccounted for. In regard to ‘winning’ the woman back, what kind of prize is spoiled milk? You ‘win’ her back… and what? You think this woman would ever have any respect and loyalty to such a cowardly man? That her behavior would magically change? Your relationship with this woman is over. Done. Thank her whatever she Revealed to you about Yourself, and move on with your life. Men spend so much of their fragile time dealing with some thing of the past, rekindling an old affair with some sub-par woman, and little do they realize they are only digging a deeper hole for themselves. They will do anything to delay the inevitable pain, and only torture themselves more.” 
			The Master paused for a beat. 
			“Keep in mind this Truth: the reason you are so stuck on her is because she is the one you encountered. There are literally millions of women on this Earth that had you met in that very same moment you met this woman, you would be just as in love with, just as broken over. Your pain and pining is because your Mechanical Mind sees a distorted Reality. You think it is about her, everything is about her, when it is really about You.”
			The Master stepped to the very front of the stage and spoke very solemnly.
			“She is only a key… a key that unlocks a space of love and beauty within Yourself.
