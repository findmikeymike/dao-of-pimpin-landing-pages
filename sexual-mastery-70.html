                <p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“But to take a woman on the Ride, to purposely manipulate… is that not pure deception? Is it not just more confusion in the world? A bid for the Shadow?’ interjected an astute and doubtful man.
			“Ah! A thinker walks among us! A fair and important question… Understand this my friend, sex is warfare, and some wars are inevitable. The very nature of the act itself is rooted in an act of aggression, and almost every move to get it, by man or woman—a subconsciously concocted manipulation. You drive a nice car to manipulate her perception of your status. She applies her cherry lipgloss to make you dream of her wet, juicy snatch. If men and women did not play this game, and did not find ways to attract and conquer each other, it would be the death of their species, so would it be fair to call this evil? If it takes some level of seduction for sex to ever occur, is it fair to damn the one who Understands versus the one who guesses or succeeds by happenstance? If it is somehow ‘evil,' it is clearly a necessary and natural one set in motion by the Almighty Pimp himself… Just know, for man, this game—this calculated behavior—is only temporary. When a man becomes a Pimp, there is no manipulation, no deceit necessary. Your essence, your mission, your passion will provide for the ultimate Ride in and of itself. You will not go cold at the zenith of your conversation with a beautiful woman out of tactic. You will go cold on her and pop back in two weeks later because there is something in your life of far greater importance. Her presence will become a genuine afterthought on your journey, and then, and only then, can her power over you be destroyed.” 
			“Master, how does one embark on this Path and still hold onto Himself, though?” barked a chubby man with a lisp.
			The Master’s head fell and shook gently side to side.
			“Hold on to Himself? Is ‘He’ not the cause of all your troubles, and exactly why you are here today? Should the three-hundred -pound woman with buffalo sauce on her blouse and thick black hairs running down her thighs—who showers once a season and complains about everything—just ‘be herself’ and expect you to love and chase her to the edge of the Earth? Enough with the Fairy Tales! The truth is ‘Who You Are’ in this moment, to a woman and the world alike, is of no interest or value, he brings no life or Feeling to the party. ‘He’ has never taken you anywhere in life but because you have gotten to know him so well, become so comfortable with him, you are afraid to leave him behind, and explore what lies Beyond. You must understand that your personality is nothing more than a collection of thoughts, feelings, and ideas from the past. It is an illusion, created to give you a false sense of identity and position in the world. You cling to it for safety and comfort—and it hinders you!” 
			“You hear that? An imaginary bag of shit floating in the wind! That’s all we are… how charming, ” snarled the dark eyed Judas.
			The Master continued as if Judas was invisible.
			“Your essence is fluid and ever-evolving. ‘Who You Are’ is whoever you Choose to be in any given moment. There are no boundaries to You, no limitations other than the ones you have carved into your Mechanical Mind. So I say to you, lighten up… enjoy the freedom, embrace the fluidity, have a little fun with ‘Yourself.’ Go try on some new personalities and behaviors, be the thing most unnatural to you. As you begin to let go of the identity you once gripped so tightly, you will notice a powerful thing start to happen: you will get a little looser, get a little more jive in your step… you will begin to notice how the world and women react differently to your Presence. You will start to realize the reason for those reactions, and the energy that truly moves the world… and this new You—not wasting all its energy and power trying to protect an ego or clinging to an idea, will have room for Presence and Magic. Soon enough this new state of Being will become as genuine and One with you as your original state of simpotry and stiffness once was. No fakery, no mystical lines necessary… The world will try its goddamn best to push back, make you cave, make you crawl back into your old shell, but you have drunk the sacred juice from the labias of the Almighty fountain, the Pimp has been born, and there is no going back… The Simp may be who you are, who you were, but he can easily be erased, and replaced with whomever it is you Choose. Even you, Mr. Finklefeet…” 
			Judas snickered and shook his head.
			“Master, for one who is very tied to his past, his ego.. who is self-admittedly close minded and rigid in identity, how can he go about separating from the old Him?” said a smokey voiced believer.
			“Think to the Method actor. Immerse yourself in someone Else. Go get yourself a cowboy hat, cowboy boots, some Levi denim and Marlboro Reds and go be the cowboy for a few days, or weeks, or months… Define Who he is and what makes him tick. Fully inhabit and operate as him throughout your day. Pick up your groceries as He… Make phone calls to women as He… become He in every last sense. Over time, as the line between You and He gets blurry, when you do not know which name to respond to, or you find yourself doing his hyena laugh, or holding a fork with the other hand, the idea of Who You Are will become less definite, more flexible… You will most likely find that right off the bat, you are far smoother and at ease with women and the world, as there will be no need to protect the ego you spent thirty years constructing. There will be a deep sense of liberation, and you may even find you enjoy your life more as the cowboy… or the Catholic priest, or the androgynous narcoleptic trucker, or whoever the hell it is that gives your spirit new Life.”
			As the Master sat back down in the lotus position and sipped his water, Raul saw a kaleidoscopic montage of himself as an array of eccentric characters swirling in his mind’s eye. He hopped from vision to vision, trying on different outfits and attitudes, inhabiting different worlds and socializing with all kinds of colorful characters. He remembered being twenty two and coming home one day in a black leather Harley jacket and how mercilessly Julia, his first wife, laughed at him. ‘Raul, you damn fool! Those jackets are made for hot bikers, not janitors. Did you get a kickstand for your mop, too?’ Raul hadn’t yet told her about his desire to get an old motorcycle, or his fantasies of the two of them taking late-night rides to escape the monotony of their days. He remembered the next afternoon, when he stuffed this vision into the pocket of the jacket and handed it back to the owner of the pawn shop, and the owner saying ‘Clutch gotcha huh?’… and the look of confusion and mild disgust on the man’s face when he replied, “The clutch of my wife.” And oddly, he felt a certain sense of peace with the memory. There was Somewhere in him that said maybe it wasn’t over… Maybe hidden under piles of Barbara Streisand vinyl and weary old lamp shades, in some dusty storage room of that pawn shop on Dunlevy Avenue, the tasseled Harley jacket would still be there, waiting for him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">The Master set his cup back down on the floor and cracked his knuckles. As the old bones in his fingers crunched, he exhaled deeply. 
			Gregory raised his hand and again, began to speak before being addressed.
			“Sir, if there is one thing that truly confuses me, it is the age old battle of the ‘nice guy’ and the ‘asshole’.. Can you tell us once and for all if it’s true that the nice guy finishes last and the asshole gets the snatch? My cousin Aadesh says I fail with the ladies because I am a nice guy and a pussy.”
			“The asshole, the nice guy… again your Mechanical Mind is just looking for molds and systems to make sense of the world, to make sense of culture. The goal is something Else entirely… the goal is to embody the fluidity and clarity of the Pimp. Besides, we must know it is not the label or name we give something that makes it What It Is. Every man in this room may call you Kapul, but what does it matter to you if your birth certificate says Gregory?” 
			“I understand, Master. But would you not agree in the simplest sense, in terms of one's attitude, it is better to inhabit the spirit of the asshole as opposed to the nice guy?” 
			“It is not the asshole that has value to the woman. You are conflating the jeweler with the diamonds held in his pockets. In the pocket of the asshole, you will find boldness, confidence, a strong Will, strict boundaries of what he will and will not tolerate, a mind that values its time and energy, a fearless demeanor when facing the world and all foes, a man who gives no fucks for the opinions of others, a man who seeks no validation from a woman... And why are these qualities enticing to the woman?”
			“They show strength, Master,” Gregory replied.
			“Yes strength, obviously… but press deeper.”
			The Master paused for a moment hoping for an answer. He continued.
			“They create emotion! Emotion! Emotion!… they set the woman off on a electrifying inner-journey as she tries to capture the unattainable… and this is why assholes generally do well with women, but in regards to his success, it is these qualities alone that move the woman. Know that a man can have these qualities without being cruel or ugly. Imagine a man with these qualities pushing an innocent elderly woman down the escalator at the mall and high-fiving his friend. How many women are lined and up and begging to lay him?”
			“None,” the congregation of men agreed. 
			The Master nodded and continued.
			“And as for the nice guy… he is despised by women and the world because he cannot be trusted. His ‘niceness’ is almost always a ploy to get something he wants but is too weak to take. He offers no emotion or Magic because he is so selfishly consumed in his own world and what it is he wants, and how others perceive him to ever step in anyone else’s world. Now ask yourself, are you He? The man so self-consumed with being liked and unoffensive to others that he lacks all Presence?” 
			The men pretended to ponder the question, knowing damn well they were He.
			“So if a man wants to be decent, and has some ethics, where does that leave him sir?”
			“Beyond! Beyond the asshole and the nice guy. Know that one can be simultaneously decent, and give of himself to the world and his fellow man, and still be bold and badass, still slay a beast at the drop of a hat, still tease the shit out of a woman and clap her cheeks in the bathroom at the local diner before the pancakes arrive. This is the way of the Pimp. He exists in a league of his own creation.”
			“Master, I will admit I am the ‘nice guy’ type, for sure. To better understand, can you explain how this plays out in the real life interaction between men and women?” said a zealous man in the front row. 
			“When men and women are together, there is always some subtle aspect of sex lurking… the polarities of the masculine and feminine have this draw towards each other ingrained. When you are with a woman you have no attraction to, or a woman is with a man she has no attraction to, this draw of polarities recedes and may be more or less extinguished, and the two can carry on as friends or associates... but when there is an attraction there, on a subconscious level or conscious level, or both simultaneously, these energies begin to Dance. And what is this Dance? It is the motion, the push and pull, the tension of these two energies moving together rhythmically, side to side, but also forward in direction.. and where is it moving forward towards? Where does it lead?”
			The Master waited for a response, but the men had none. They were still trying to put it all together. He continued.
			“The nice guy is not even aware of the Dance’s existence, and because he is not aware of it on a conscious level, there is no chance for sex to happen, as it takes the conscious aspect of the Dance to fuel the interaction forward towards sex and union. He is so consumed with coming across pleasantly and making a good impression, that there is no action, no tension, no Magic… only reaction to both the woman and the world around him. He is soft and flaccid, and as he inhabits this frame of being the reactor, the receiver, more passive in nature, he has moved fully into the Feminine like the woman. And naturally, like everything under the sun, Universal Law says these energies of the same vibration will repel. The woman says 'My! This beer tastes like urine!’ The man who chose and ordered them yelps ‘Why yes they do my lady! Just terrible! My apologies—let me get us another round.’ The woman says ‘I can’t get enough of this band playing tonight!’ The man, who knows the music is shit, replies ‘Oh my god! They’re so good right?!’ She asks him if he ‘always gels his hair like that?’ and unaware as to whether her comment is a compliment or a cutdown, he assumes the worst and becomes anxious, ‘Well… no… I... just here and there I guess… but it probably looks better when it’s dry... I don’t know?’ For the man is telling the truth, he does not have any conviction in his hair, or anything else in life.”
			Judas discretely tapped at his gelled top to feel the placement and status of his hair. He quietly looked to the men next to him to see if they noticed, but their eyes were glued on the Master. 
			“Towards the end of this dreadful night, they sit at a table by the bar, and a moment of silence begins to blossom and the man, terrified of the Void, thrusts his voice forward, ‘So... when are you free next? I’ve had a great time and would love to see you again.’ The woman’s face contorts as she tries her best to camouflage every fiber of her being cringing in agony. She replies ‘Hmm… I’m not too sure. I have a lot going on the next couple weeks but let’s keep in touch.’ Do you see how pathetic and soul-crushing this scene is? Are you aware that this man has a better shot at hitting the Mega-Millions than bedding or dating this woman? Do you understand that if this man had simply inversed every word, every look, every move he made tonight, he would have faired far better by default? This is why I am telling you that if every one of your interactions with women plays out the same way, there is something much deeper that needs to be addressed in You.”
			“Sir, it appears you have been eaves dropping on my dates!” remarked one of the converted men playfully. 
			“Hell! Mine too! Now tell us of the Pimp, Master,” chimed another enthusiastic man.
			“As for the Pimp, his night with the same woman looks very different, so much so that if the other man saw it unfold, he would have no clue as to what was Unfolding and would not believe his eyes. The Pimp sets a date with the woman at a bar a five minute walk from his house, as the location makes certain possibilities much more... possible. He’s also aware of the edge he has socially in this atmosphere as it is his ‘home court.’ And because he’s a bit preoccupied finishing a Python code he has been working on all week, tending to his true calling in life, he unintentionally shows up thirteen minutes late. He approaches the table casually, in a pair of old jeans and a nondescript t-shirt, with no apparent anxiety over his tardiness.. and as he takes a seat next to the woman, she says to him ‘Well well well, nice of you to have shown up. I was about to leave,’ and the man replies ‘Oh cut me some slack… I was getting all done up for you.' Notice the subtle push: he shows up late with no remorse, and the pull: he jokes that it was only because he was trying to impress her. An obvious fib and tease that simultaneously disarms her ego, mocks flattery, and reasserts the ‘Man to Woman’ sexual dynamic established in their initial communications. She can sense immediately that this man knows how to Dance and that he is not going to be like the last seven impotent schlubs she went out with. He immediately presents some level of challenge to her. Are you with me?”
			The congregation of men nodded in unison. They were fully enthralled, as if for the first time seeing behind a curtain into a hidden world they knew existed but never understood.
			The Master carried on.
			“A few minutes later, a feisty young lady the man has dated in the past drunkenly approaches the table and says ‘Look who it is? Does your parole officer know you’re here?’ The silly young lady, not understanding her own breed’s psychology, thinks her comment will act as some sort of quasi cock-block to the man, but only adds fuel to the fire… the emotional landscape of the woman sitting next to him is now ablaze with curiosity and intrigue. She also feels a subtle tinge of jealousy in the left side of her gut, as her keen intuition tells her these two have definitely slept together. The man sets down his drink and in no rush responds to the young drunk lady ‘Luckily he is of no concern.. twenty bucks goes a long ways these days.’ The young drunk lady stands frozen. She has been outwitted and her attack, vaporized. She stares at him for a moment, and he is unmoved. She is out of ammunition, accepts defeat, and stumbles off into the night. ‘Parole?’ his date playfully jeers. ‘Only petty crimes, mostly harmless,’ the man replies… And why does he respond in this manner?”
			“Because he knows that the straight answer holds no Magic or Feeling,” Raul retorted.
			The Master grinned and shook his fist with mirth.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“So he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself ‘the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,’ so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: ‘The first five rounds are on you.’ Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn’t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn’t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn’t for another two weeks—suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?”
			“I am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!” Gregory shouted without hesitation.
			“Yes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.’ This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of ‘losing’ some girl he doesn’t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.”
			“Sir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women… but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?” replied a curious believer.
			“No, no, no… you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I’m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from… a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call… I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot… there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself ‘How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?’ You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.”  
			“So I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?” replied the man.
			“No—on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection… for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp’s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man’s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Okay? You craft sandwiches… and you say that as if it is an empty pursuit… a realm that holds no potential for any kind of evolution or magic... but let me tell you the potential Mission of man comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. It is not in the “what man does” but in the “how he does it.” Do not think that Mission means a man must start a multi-million dollar company, or win an Oscar, or reach some fantastical level of social status. You may have a man that’s truest calling in life is simply to Teach... maybe his passion is for history and he teaches a middle school class. What matters is the hunger, relentlessness, and creativity he approaches his teaching with. How far he is willing to push to be the most legendary teacher that ever walked the Earth? Let me ask you… why do you spend your life making sandwiches?” 
			“Because it pays a fair wage sir, and I get joy in seeing people eat. I love sauces and the way they can bring a sandwich to life. I put sauces on everything.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Sammy Davis Jr., you are under arrest by the Federal Police of Justice for high crimes of the many. You have the right to remain silent as I hereby announce these crimes. Under the newly passed Federal Women’s Protection Act, in effect April 16th, pursuant code 769BBC, “Pimping" in all of its forms comes with a life sentence… The crimes you have committed under the umbrella of this law include: One… Unlawful disclosure of the Woman’s Psychology. Two… Manipulation of Historical Sexual Dynamics. Three… Radicalizing and Sexually Weaponizing Males. Four… Collecting money in Women Endangering Pursuits… last but not least, Five— using the word “Faggot” and “bitch” among other terms deemed unlawful. We have all of this on tape.” 
			The Master dropped his head and began to sob. 
			“But… but... I’m Black?" he whimpered.</p>
