                <p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">The Master set his cup back down on the floor and cracked his knuckles. As the old bones in his fingers crunched, he exhaled deeply. 
			Gregory raised his hand and again, began to speak before being addressed.
			“Sir, if there is one thing that truly confuses me, it is the age old battle of the ‘nice guy’ and the ‘asshole’.. Can you tell us once and for all if it’s true that the nice guy finishes last and the asshole gets the snatch? My cousin Aadesh says I fail with the ladies because I am a nice guy and a pussy.”
			“The asshole, the nice guy… again your Mechanical Mind is just looking for molds and systems to make sense of the world, to make sense of culture. The goal is something Else entirely… the goal is to embody the fluidity and clarity of the Pimp. Besides, we must know it is not the label or name we give something that makes it What It Is. Every man in this room may call you Kapul, but what does it matter to you if your birth certificate says Gregory?” 
			“I understand, Master. But would you not agree in the simplest sense, in terms of one's attitude, it is better to inhabit the spirit of the asshole as opposed to the nice guy?” 
			“It is not the asshole that has value to the woman. You are conflating the jeweler with the diamonds held in his pockets. In the pocket of the asshole, you will find boldness, confidence, a strong Will, strict boundaries of what he will and will not tolerate, a mind that values its time and energy, a fearless demeanor when facing the world and all foes, a man who gives no fucks for the opinions of others, a man who seeks no validation from a woman... And why are these qualities enticing to the woman?”
			“They show strength, Master,” Gregory replied.
			“Yes strength, obviously… but press deeper.”
			The Master paused for a moment hoping for an answer. He continued.
			“They create emotion! Emotion! Emotion!… they set the woman off on a electrifying inner-journey as she tries to capture the unattainable… and this is why assholes generally do well with women, but in regards to his success, it is these qualities alone that move the woman. Know that a man can have these qualities without being cruel or ugly. Imagine a man with these qualities pushing an innocent elderly woman down the escalator at the mall and high-fiving his friend. How many women are lined and up and begging to lay him?”
			“None,” the congregation of men agreed. 
			The Master nodded and continued.
			“And as for the nice guy… he is despised by women and the world because he cannot be trusted. His ‘niceness’ is almost always a ploy to get something he wants but is too weak to take. He offers no emotion or Magic because he is so selfishly consumed in his own world and what it is he wants, and how others perceive him to ever step in anyone else’s world. Now ask yourself, are you He? The man so self-consumed with being liked and unoffensive to others that he lacks all Presence?” 
			The men pretended to ponder the question, knowing damn well they were He.
			“So if a man wants to be decent, and has some ethics, where does that leave him sir?”
			“Beyond! Beyond the asshole and the nice guy. Know that one can be simultaneously decent, and give of himself to the world and his fellow man, and still be bold and badass, still slay a beast at the drop of a hat, still tease the shit out of a woman and clap her cheeks in the bathroom at the local diner before the pancakes arrive. This is the way of the Pimp. He exists in a league of his own creation.”
			“Master, I will admit I am the ‘nice guy’ type, for sure. To better understand, can you explain how this plays out in the real life interaction between men and women?” said a zealous man in the front row. 
			“When men and women are together, there is always some subtle aspect of sex lurking… the polarities of the masculine and feminine have this draw towards each other ingrained. When you are with a woman you have no attraction to, or a woman is with a man she has no attraction to, this draw of polarities recedes and may be more or less extinguished, and the two can carry on as friends or associates... but when there is an attraction there, on a subconscious level or conscious level, or both simultaneously, these energies begin to Dance. And what is this Dance? It is the motion, the push and pull, the tension of these two energies moving together rhythmically, side to side, but also forward in direction.. and where is it moving forward towards? Where does it lead?”
			The Master waited for a response, but the men had none. They were still trying to put it all together. He continued.
			“The nice guy is not even aware of the Dance’s existence, and because he is not aware of it on a conscious level, there is no chance for sex to happen, as it takes the conscious aspect of the Dance to fuel the interaction forward towards sex and union. He is so consumed with coming across pleasantly and making a good impression, that there is no action, no tension, no Magic… only reaction to both the woman and the world around him. He is soft and flaccid, and as he inhabits this frame of being the reactor, the receiver, more passive in nature, he has moved fully into the Feminine like the woman. And naturally, like everything under the sun, Universal Law says these energies of the same vibration will repel. The woman says 'My! This beer tastes like urine!’ The man who chose and ordered them yelps ‘Why yes they do my lady! Just terrible! My apologies—let me get us another round.’ The woman says ‘I can’t get enough of this band playing tonight!’ The man, who knows the music is shit, replies ‘Oh my god! They’re so good right?!’ She asks him if he ‘always gels his hair like that?’ and unaware as to whether her comment is a compliment or a cutdown, he assumes the worst and becomes anxious, ‘Well… no… I... just here and there I guess… but it probably looks better when it’s dry... I don’t know?’ For the man is telling the truth, he does not have any conviction in his hair, or anything else in life.”
			Judas discretely tapped at his gelled top to feel the placement and status of his hair. He quietly looked to the men next to him to see if they noticed, but their eyes were glued on the Master. 
			“Towards the end of this dreadful night, they sit at a table by the bar, and a moment of silence begins to blossom and the man, terrified of the Void, thrusts his voice forward, ‘So... when are you free next? I’ve had a great time and would love to see you again.’ The woman’s face contorts as she tries her best to camouflage every fiber of her being cringing in agony. She replies ‘Hmm… I’m not too sure. I have a lot going on the next couple weeks but let’s keep in touch.’ Do you see how pathetic and soul-crushing this scene is? Are you aware that this man has a better shot at hitting the Mega-Millions than bedding or dating this woman? Do you understand that if this man had simply inversed every word, every look, every move he made tonight, he would have faired far better by default? This is why I am telling you that if every one of your interactions with women plays out the same way, there is something much deeper that needs to be addressed in You.”
			“Sir, it appears you have been eaves dropping on my dates!” remarked one of the converted men playfully. 
			“Hell! Mine too! Now tell us of the Pimp, Master,” chimed another enthusiastic man.
			“As for the Pimp, his night with the same woman looks very different, so much so that if the other man saw it unfold, he would have no clue as to what was Unfolding and would not believe his eyes. The Pimp sets a date with the woman at a bar a five minute walk from his house, as the location makes certain possibilities much more... possible. He’s also aware of the edge he has socially in this atmosphere as it is his ‘home court.’ And because he’s a bit preoccupied finishing a Python code he has been working on all week, tending to his true calling in life, he unintentionally shows up thirteen minutes late. He approaches the table casually, in a pair of old jeans and a nondescript t-shirt, with no apparent anxiety over his tardiness.. and as he takes a seat next to the woman, she says to him ‘Well well well, nice of you to have shown up. I was about to leave,’ and the man replies ‘Oh cut me some slack… I was getting all done up for you.' Notice the subtle push: he shows up late with no remorse, and the pull: he jokes that it was only because he was trying to impress her. An obvious fib and tease that simultaneously disarms her ego, mocks flattery, and reasserts the ‘Man to Woman’ sexual dynamic established in their initial communications. She can sense immediately that this man knows how to Dance and that he is not going to be like the last seven impotent schlubs she went out with. He immediately presents some level of challenge to her. Are you with me?”
			The congregation of men nodded in unison. They were fully enthralled, as if for the first time seeing behind a curtain into a hidden world they knew existed but never understood.
			The Master carried on.
			“A few minutes later, a feisty young lady the man has dated in the past drunkenly approaches the table and says ‘Look who it is? Does your parole officer know you’re here?’ The silly young lady, not understanding her own breed’s psychology, thinks her comment will act as some sort of quasi cock-block to the man, but only adds fuel to the fire… the emotional landscape of the woman sitting next to him is now ablaze with curiosity and intrigue. She also feels a subtle tinge of jealousy in the left side of her gut, as her keen intuition tells her these two have definitely slept together. The man sets down his drink and in no rush responds to the young drunk lady ‘Luckily he is of no concern.. twenty bucks goes a long ways these days.’ The young drunk lady stands frozen. She has been outwitted and her attack, vaporized. She stares at him for a moment, and he is unmoved. She is out of ammunition, accepts defeat, and stumbles off into the night. ‘Parole?’ his date playfully jeers. ‘Only petty crimes, mostly harmless,’ the man replies… And why does he respond in this manner?”
			“Because he knows that the straight answer holds no Magic or Feeling,” Raul retorted.
			The Master grinned and shook his fist with mirth.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, exactly… because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails—she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers—the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap… their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.”
			The Master paused for a beat.
			“Are we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?”
			The flock nodded. 
			The Master continued.
			“Twenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, “Come, it’s time you show me how to dance.” Notice the way this man Moves—fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature—vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure—and the ‘proving’—on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old ‘man impresses woman’ adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.”
			The Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.
			"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist—no hesitation, no fear—and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor… alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it… for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself—whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who’s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. ‘Take me, you wild stallion,’ she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye… the soft glow of her skin… ‘It is time,’ he says to himself. So the man—’’
			A lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically— 
			“Sir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I’m sure you understand Master!” 
			The Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. 
			“Which one of these men next to you is erect?” howled The Master.
			“It is I, Master.” murmured a soft voice. 
			The man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,
			“If any consolation, sir… gentleman… I don’t believe it is a gay erection… it is just that Master’s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual… he captured my emotions and I apologize,” he said softly.
			The Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. 
			“Apologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here… Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings… we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or… purely mechanical,” the Master said calmly. 
			The Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. 
			“You may move your seat... six inches closer to him.” 
			“Sir?” gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. 
			“You heard me… his little erection is not going to harm you… you said where you’re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,” quipped the Master. 
			“Sir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!” said the man, now on the verge of tears.
 			“Then leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!” 
			The Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.
			“Let us proceed… where did we leave off?” said the Master. 
			“Master, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels… dare I say… sinister… or Machiavellian,” a man replied.
			“What you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself… do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man… You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.”
			“But Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?” objected the man.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“She is not the enemy. She is just like me!” Shouted the men devoted men. 
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” yelled The Master.
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” chanted the choir. 
			“She shits and she does not always wash!”
			“She shits and she does not always wash!” they roared! 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“Very good,” said the Master. 
			“Hold tight to the mantra, men! The mantra is all we need!” shouted the chubby man with the lisp.
 			The Master threw his hand up in the air to halt the blossoming of a false notion.
			“No! For this is just the beginning! This is only one mantra, one practice, one compartment of the Mind. We will not stop here… We must eliminate not just the Web of the Woman, but every web you have ever spun!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Who is next? You, Judas, what is it you fear?”			
			“I fear being conned by Snakes who claim to know the Way,” he snipped back with a deadly spite.
			“And yet you have no awareness that You are the true con of your own narrative. Your mind is a fortress of fear, on a suicide mission to Prove… Always trying to Prove… For the man so enslaved in this hellish realm misses the Whole of Life, held captive by the claws of his own ego. He wants so desperately to be shaken, to be woken from his slumber but his pride is so booming and monstrous, it drowns outs every ringing bell.”
			“Kiss - my - ass - you old coon,” Judas spit back.
			The room froze. All eyes turned to The Master. His face was carved from stone—utterly devoid of any emotion. With a piercing calm, he hiked up his velvet pants, stepped to the edge of the stage, and dropped his old bones over the lip. He moved with purpose now—skirting around the rows of chairs like a serpent coiling its prey. With each footstep, the room seemed to shift. More force. More weight. More speed. Then he lurched—a full bodied surge—straight toward Judas, never breaking his searing gaze on the man for a second. The congregation of men were on edge of their seats. Their fear and awe of the moment hung in the air.. 
			With each step closer the Master came, Judas’s testicles shrank three millimeters. The muscles in his body began to clench so tightly they were on the verge of incineration. His gelled hair was so brittle you could hear the crackling and smoldering. 
			As the Master closed in, Judas began to shake violently. He squeezed his eyes shut and clenched at his guts, summoning every atom of strength not to shit himself… and then…  in the infinite silence and black of his mind, he felt something… in his ear… a deep penetration—slimy, turbulent, relentless. He whimpered in helpless agony as the walls of his canal were stretched and shredded. As the penetration came to its climax, he heard the pitched-down laughter and chanting of the men, and a faint robotic voice shout:
			“W E T   W I L L Y ! ! !”
			Judas crumbled. His body, his mind, his soul… violated and pillaged in slow motion, pumped and dumped by an ungodly force.
			“Judas, the fun is over. I have finished. Now Open - Your - Eyes,” The Master said softly.  
			With a pounding breath, Judas timidly cracked open his left eye. The Master grabbed him forcefully by the cheeks, and with his face mere centimeters from Judas’s, he commanded:
			“It is time to Wake Up my boy. You do not know why you came here today, but I do… You came for this moment. For this very. fucking. moment.”
			The Master let go of his cheeks and began to ease his face away from Judas’s ever so slowly. As the Master walked back to the stage he shouted buoyantly and clapped his hands.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, so there is some passion there, some curiosity… Some juice to the endeavor beyond the pay… You want to feed your fellow man, and the focus and essence of what you do is in the Creation and giving of something of substance to the world. Then by god, make the best fucking sandwiches the world has ever tasted! Step in that shop every day with the mindset that there is the possibility of the Unknown happening… create a space for the magic and step into it! No preconceived notions, no mental scripts or limitations! You love sauces, oh?!”
			“I fucking love them sir. A good sauce is like a good woman. Hard to find and in limited supply,” replied the pudgy adept.
			“Then stay an hour late every day for an entire year, mixing the sauces and rubs in different combinations and proportions until you have stumbled on a sauce like no other! A sauce so zesty and delicious it sends a shiver down the spine! Toss and turn in your bed in the late hours of the night deliberating on the best name for your sauce and how you are going to deliver it to every tongue on Earth! Make the most beautiful sandwich you have ever made, lather it with your Magic Sauce and present it to your boss… and when he takes that first bite, and his eyes roll back into his head in ecstasy, you tell him, “My special sauce sir, The Magic Sauce! I have spent a year on this and I would love your blessing in adding it to the menu!” And how will he respond?”
			“He’ll love it! He’ll say it’s genius!” shouted the man excitedly.
			“No! He will not! For his Mechanical Mind will tell him that your sauce may steal his thunder, and encroach on his power over the shop! So what will you say to him?”
			“I will say but sir—’’
			“You will say nothing to him! To bloody hell with him! He will not stop the Sauce! And so you offer it to customers when he is not there… and soon enough when everyone in that sandwich shop is lining up for your goddamn sauce and the big man gets hip to the jig and fires your ass, you smile to yourself knowing that your first set-back, the first test of your Will, means you are on the right track. So you press on… you take your earnings and buy the ingredients in bulk, and start concocting it at home… until your entire refrigerator is stocked with ‘The Magic Sauce.’ You go door to door, giving samples to people and selling your sauce… And soon enough folks are emailing the local paper about the young guy selling his sauce door to door, and the paper writes an article… the local market asks you if they can sell your sauce… and now, like an alchemist, you have transformed a mundane job and life in the sandwich shop into something More, into a Mission! And with each hurdle and each mini victory, your heart will sing and your mind will start looking at all the impossibles as Possible. You will start to see your life and destiny through a new lens. This is what puts blood in a man’s veins and a shine in his eyes. Is this a pursuit you are Ready for my boy?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Speak to us more of… the… Tests along the way, Master. It seems as if… as if… all of life itself is just one Test… after… another..” said the ginger man with a waver in his voice.
			“As I said before, the Tests of life, of the woman.. they are not the enemy. They are not a force of evil. They are your friend. They are there to aid and propel your evolution. Like everything else we have discussed today, the first step is to recognize and be conscious of the tests. Let’s go back to the woman, as her tests are relentless and a metaphor for all of life tests. The woman’s tests are a constant and endless check on man as to whether he is centered in himself and his Mission. The majority of you are here because you fail the very first test of the woman, and that is having a basic conviction in yourself. Her entire evolution has wired her to smell your bullshit from a mile away, as her evolutionary survival depended on it. You approach her and she senses your fear and incongruence, she senses you have no direction in your step, and her subconscious mind sounds the alarm: ‘He is afraid and shook by a 140-pound girl that wishes him no harm.. what will the world do to him?!’ And she is right!”
			The Master was in the Zone. The pace of his speech picked up as he continued.
			“Now let’s say you have some semblance of conviction and competence and you have begun dating a woman for a few months, and she says to you ‘I think its silly your refrigerator is full of sauces and find it a bit embarrassing to see you going door to door like a peasant trying hustle your sauce. My father said he would give you a real job.’ What does the average man do? He quits, in fear he may lose her... and on the surface she is happy, because here is a man that was so afraid to lose her, he gave up on The Mission. She feels validated in her Womanly Woo and influence, but beneath the surface, deep in her soul she is repulsed, and her attraction withers. The man was swayed from his own Will and Path by an outside opinion and a few unpleasant comments… How many of you have been this man? How many of you are still He?”
			Raul was the first to raise his hand. He had always been this man, oblivious to the glaringly obvious. His newfound clarity on a world once shrouded in mystery and chaos was truly emancipating. 
			The Master signaled for the men to put down their hands as he continued the teaching.
			“Know that she will plunder you with a barrage of trivial tests too, from the ‘I don’t like this song. Change it,’ to the ‘You would never really vote for that man, would you?’ All these can be translated into the same question ‘Are you a Pimp or a bitch? Are you about that life or are you not?’ And the correct answer is always your Truth, your Will, what you Want for Yourself... no matter how offended or disgruntled it may make her on the surface, know that on a deeper level you sticking to your guns and standing where you Choose to stand is what draws her closer and makes her gain trust in you as a man. And as for the true Pimp…”
			The Master smiled a devious smile.
			“The true Pimp who understands all of this knows how to flip the script on her entirely. He is on a date with a woman and starts deploying his own tests and challenges before she even has a chance to set the age old ‘I’m the woman and you are here to impress me… now here’s your first test’ frame. She scrambles as her Mechanical Mind is not used to being in such a peculiar and compromising position. He is tickled to see the true simp come out in her.. ‘No, no!’ she says, ‘I only went to see Maroon 5 because my friend had bought the tickets!’ The pimp chuckles in amusement and pokes at her, ‘Riiiiiight.. Check please!” 
			“Brilliant, sir! But… how on Earth is the woman so damn crafty? How many hours a day does she scheme on the man?” said a spirited young man.
			The Master had a good laugh at this. 
			“No, no… the vast majority of the time, a woman’s test are not consciously concocted. She is not off in some dark alley trading ‘catch the man’ tests with other women… The testing is wired and of an evolutionary nature. It is a survival mechanism of her subconscious mind to weed out the simps and weaklings from the true Pimps... and it is for this reason that her tests are not always easy to recognize... as you will not sense any level of deception or fuckery in the delivery of her tests… but know that until you have proved unwavering conviction in yourself and your Path, her tests, and the world’s tests, will not cease. Again, we must not see this is a burden, but a gift and service to keep you on your toes and steadfast on the Mission. Know that just like the undertaking of the Mission, we are not out to pass a woman’s tests to keep the woman or please the woman, we pass these tests for ourselves, for our own evolution. Her attraction is just a symptom.”</p>
