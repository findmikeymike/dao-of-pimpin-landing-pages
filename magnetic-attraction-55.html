                <p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">The Master set his cup back down on the floor and cracked his knuckles. As the old bones in his fingers crunched, he exhaled deeply. 
			Gregory raised his hand and again, began to speak before being addressed.
			“Sir, if there is one thing that truly confuses me, it is the age old battle of the ‘nice guy’ and the ‘asshole’.. Can you tell us once and for all if it’s true that the nice guy finishes last and the asshole gets the snatch? My cousin Aadesh says I fail with the ladies because I am a nice guy and a pussy.”
			“The asshole, the nice guy… again your Mechanical Mind is just looking for molds and systems to make sense of the world, to make sense of culture. The goal is something Else entirely… the goal is to embody the fluidity and clarity of the Pimp. Besides, we must know it is not the label or name we give something that makes it What It Is. Every man in this room may call you Kapul, but what does it matter to you if your birth certificate says Gregory?” 
			“I understand, Master. But would you not agree in the simplest sense, in terms of one's attitude, it is better to inhabit the spirit of the asshole as opposed to the nice guy?” 
			“It is not the asshole that has value to the woman. You are conflating the jeweler with the diamonds held in his pockets. In the pocket of the asshole, you will find boldness, confidence, a strong Will, strict boundaries of what he will and will not tolerate, a mind that values its time and energy, a fearless demeanor when facing the world and all foes, a man who gives no fucks for the opinions of others, a man who seeks no validation from a woman... And why are these qualities enticing to the woman?”
			“They show strength, Master,” Gregory replied.
			“Yes strength, obviously… but press deeper.”
			The Master paused for a moment hoping for an answer. He continued.
			“They create emotion! Emotion! Emotion!… they set the woman off on a electrifying inner-journey as she tries to capture the unattainable… and this is why assholes generally do well with women, but in regards to his success, it is these qualities alone that move the woman. Know that a man can have these qualities without being cruel or ugly. Imagine a man with these qualities pushing an innocent elderly woman down the escalator at the mall and high-fiving his friend. How many women are lined and up and begging to lay him?”
			“None,” the congregation of men agreed. 
			The Master nodded and continued.
			“And as for the nice guy… he is despised by women and the world because he cannot be trusted. His ‘niceness’ is almost always a ploy to get something he wants but is too weak to take. He offers no emotion or Magic because he is so selfishly consumed in his own world and what it is he wants, and how others perceive him to ever step in anyone else’s world. Now ask yourself, are you He? The man so self-consumed with being liked and unoffensive to others that he lacks all Presence?” 
			The men pretended to ponder the question, knowing damn well they were He.
			“So if a man wants to be decent, and has some ethics, where does that leave him sir?”
			“Beyond! Beyond the asshole and the nice guy. Know that one can be simultaneously decent, and give of himself to the world and his fellow man, and still be bold and badass, still slay a beast at the drop of a hat, still tease the shit out of a woman and clap her cheeks in the bathroom at the local diner before the pancakes arrive. This is the way of the Pimp. He exists in a league of his own creation.”
			“Master, I will admit I am the ‘nice guy’ type, for sure. To better understand, can you explain how this plays out in the real life interaction between men and women?” said a zealous man in the front row. 
			“When men and women are together, there is always some subtle aspect of sex lurking… the polarities of the masculine and feminine have this draw towards each other ingrained. When you are with a woman you have no attraction to, or a woman is with a man she has no attraction to, this draw of polarities recedes and may be more or less extinguished, and the two can carry on as friends or associates... but when there is an attraction there, on a subconscious level or conscious level, or both simultaneously, these energies begin to Dance. And what is this Dance? It is the motion, the push and pull, the tension of these two energies moving together rhythmically, side to side, but also forward in direction.. and where is it moving forward towards? Where does it lead?”
			The Master waited for a response, but the men had none. They were still trying to put it all together. He continued.
			“The nice guy is not even aware of the Dance’s existence, and because he is not aware of it on a conscious level, there is no chance for sex to happen, as it takes the conscious aspect of the Dance to fuel the interaction forward towards sex and union. He is so consumed with coming across pleasantly and making a good impression, that there is no action, no tension, no Magic… only reaction to both the woman and the world around him. He is soft and flaccid, and as he inhabits this frame of being the reactor, the receiver, more passive in nature, he has moved fully into the Feminine like the woman. And naturally, like everything under the sun, Universal Law says these energies of the same vibration will repel. The woman says 'My! This beer tastes like urine!’ The man who chose and ordered them yelps ‘Why yes they do my lady! Just terrible! My apologies—let me get us another round.’ The woman says ‘I can’t get enough of this band playing tonight!’ The man, who knows the music is shit, replies ‘Oh my god! They’re so good right?!’ She asks him if he ‘always gels his hair like that?’ and unaware as to whether her comment is a compliment or a cutdown, he assumes the worst and becomes anxious, ‘Well… no… I... just here and there I guess… but it probably looks better when it’s dry... I don’t know?’ For the man is telling the truth, he does not have any conviction in his hair, or anything else in life.”
			Judas discretely tapped at his gelled top to feel the placement and status of his hair. He quietly looked to the men next to him to see if they noticed, but their eyes were glued on the Master. 
			“Towards the end of this dreadful night, they sit at a table by the bar, and a moment of silence begins to blossom and the man, terrified of the Void, thrusts his voice forward, ‘So... when are you free next? I’ve had a great time and would love to see you again.’ The woman’s face contorts as she tries her best to camouflage every fiber of her being cringing in agony. She replies ‘Hmm… I’m not too sure. I have a lot going on the next couple weeks but let’s keep in touch.’ Do you see how pathetic and soul-crushing this scene is? Are you aware that this man has a better shot at hitting the Mega-Millions than bedding or dating this woman? Do you understand that if this man had simply inversed every word, every look, every move he made tonight, he would have faired far better by default? This is why I am telling you that if every one of your interactions with women plays out the same way, there is something much deeper that needs to be addressed in You.”
			“Sir, it appears you have been eaves dropping on my dates!” remarked one of the converted men playfully. 
			“Hell! Mine too! Now tell us of the Pimp, Master,” chimed another enthusiastic man.
			“As for the Pimp, his night with the same woman looks very different, so much so that if the other man saw it unfold, he would have no clue as to what was Unfolding and would not believe his eyes. The Pimp sets a date with the woman at a bar a five minute walk from his house, as the location makes certain possibilities much more... possible. He’s also aware of the edge he has socially in this atmosphere as it is his ‘home court.’ And because he’s a bit preoccupied finishing a Python code he has been working on all week, tending to his true calling in life, he unintentionally shows up thirteen minutes late. He approaches the table casually, in a pair of old jeans and a nondescript t-shirt, with no apparent anxiety over his tardiness.. and as he takes a seat next to the woman, she says to him ‘Well well well, nice of you to have shown up. I was about to leave,’ and the man replies ‘Oh cut me some slack… I was getting all done up for you.' Notice the subtle push: he shows up late with no remorse, and the pull: he jokes that it was only because he was trying to impress her. An obvious fib and tease that simultaneously disarms her ego, mocks flattery, and reasserts the ‘Man to Woman’ sexual dynamic established in their initial communications. She can sense immediately that this man knows how to Dance and that he is not going to be like the last seven impotent schlubs she went out with. He immediately presents some level of challenge to her. Are you with me?”
			The congregation of men nodded in unison. They were fully enthralled, as if for the first time seeing behind a curtain into a hidden world they knew existed but never understood.
			The Master carried on.
			“A few minutes later, a feisty young lady the man has dated in the past drunkenly approaches the table and says ‘Look who it is? Does your parole officer know you’re here?’ The silly young lady, not understanding her own breed’s psychology, thinks her comment will act as some sort of quasi cock-block to the man, but only adds fuel to the fire… the emotional landscape of the woman sitting next to him is now ablaze with curiosity and intrigue. She also feels a subtle tinge of jealousy in the left side of her gut, as her keen intuition tells her these two have definitely slept together. The man sets down his drink and in no rush responds to the young drunk lady ‘Luckily he is of no concern.. twenty bucks goes a long ways these days.’ The young drunk lady stands frozen. She has been outwitted and her attack, vaporized. She stares at him for a moment, and he is unmoved. She is out of ammunition, accepts defeat, and stumbles off into the night. ‘Parole?’ his date playfully jeers. ‘Only petty crimes, mostly harmless,’ the man replies… And why does he respond in this manner?”
			“Because he knows that the straight answer holds no Magic or Feeling,” Raul retorted.
			The Master grinned and shook his fist with mirth.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Master speak to us of the Process… in real life, how one begins this transformation,” said one of devout men. 
			“Before you splash one drop of shitty cologne on your neck or step one toe towards the Path of the Pimp... you must know the reality. You must know that in this moment, you and every man around you is only flirting with an idea, finger-blasting a beautiful fantasy. Like all the greatest things on the journey of life, it will take every drop of blood in your veins, every bead of sweat your skin can muster, for the unlikely chance at Pimpdom. The Path of the Pimp will take much work—it will take pain, a hell-storm of discomfort and embarrassment... Look at the man beside you, now look around the room…”
			The Master paused for a moment as the men surveyed those around them. He continued,
			“Now think back to the assembly of hemorrhoidal lumps who scampered out of here and rushed home to their infernos of emptiness before the show even began... and hear the Truth: In this moment, you think I am talking to you, that I am here for you, and that this room is some sort of mystical fraternity of rejects that are off to slay the dragon together. You imagine us meeting up a few years down the line, drinking cocktails and eating chicken fingers, busting each other's chops, and sharing nude screenshots of beautiful women in compromising positions… Yet again, you have fallen for the Fairy Tale and deceived yourself. The truth is, I am here today, right now, in this very fucking moment speaking to One man. It is he, and only he that I am speaking to. It is he, and only he, that has the chance to walk the Path of the Pimp. The rest of you are nothing more than extras cast for an hourly rate to fill his story with color and motion. So I ask you now, in your heart of hearts: are you He? If not, I am promising you this endeavor is not only a waste of your time, but will cause more pain and discomfort.”
			Twelve men got up and left the room. The remaining men got up and filled their seats closer to the Master. Raul, Gregory, and the chubby man with the lisp sat front and center. Judas, the lone wolf, refused to yield to the Master and stayed put in his seat, just close enough to lob his grenades, but far enough to feel untouchable.
			The air of camaraderie was gone. The feeling of Simp fellowship and Beta brotherhood, liquidated. For every man now Understood that if by the grace of the Almighty Pimp it was his mission, he would be going alone... 
			“Master I don’t presume you will tell us which man here is He, but may I ask if you think there is any hope for me in particular? Could you imagine me ever becoming even the lowliest of Pimps with a generous effort? I work many hours of the week, sir, but I am determined to have my pie.” 
			The Master laughed hysterically. He laughed so hard he fell backwards out of his upright posture and was laid flat on the ground. It took him a full minute to compose himself. The room was silent again, and while still laid out flat on his back, the Master spoke in a soft and sympathetic tone. 
			“Kapul, if my opinion is what you seek... I could not imagine you fucking a dead bird in a bush, let alone a woman. You’re a computer technician… a computer tech-nish-an... and nothing more. You were born to chip away at motherboards and untangle snake pits of electronic cords. You are weak, your mustache, repulsive… Your little hands equipped to your body for no other reason than to place bottles of discount lotion up by the register, your eyes, only placed in your skull to scan obscure pornography until the hour when night meets day. There is no hope for you. No hope at all. It gives me no pleasure to say this, Kapul… You are dismissed.”
 			And with his words, a different type of silence fell on the room of men. A silence so sad and empty it was as if the world itself stopped spinning to pay its respect to the complete annihilation of a human soul. Gregory sat there like a stone, the blood from his face and what remained of his erection drained down into his little feet. The hairs of his mustache curled inwards, as if the last drops of life and sweat had been snuffed out of them. They had given it everything they had, trying to convince the world that together they were a real mustache, but the time had come when they could no longer even fool themselves. 	For Gregory and the Mini Mustache, the voyage to the ‘Land of a Thousand Yearning Pussys and Maybe a Good Wife,’ was over. 
			“Go on now little Indian man! Surely there are some other gay little Indians you can seduce at the local curry hole! The rest of us want to hear what other nonsense this ‘Master’ has in store!” Judas snipped. 
			Gregory began to rise to his feet but a swift and strong arm jerked him back down.				“Who are these men to tell you your fate? If the Master’s words are Truth, then it is you— and you alone— who decides what Awaits you. Do not fail yourself, Kapul,” Raul whispered with an unusual conviction. 
			There was a gleam in Gregory’s left eye, and then a gleam in the right. He leaned into Raul, paused for a beat, and whispered back:
			“For you my brother in pussy, anti-virus scan… any time… free of charge.”
 			Gregory shot a wink at Raul, turned to the Master, who was still laid out on the floor, and shouted.
			“But Master you made no mention of my tongue! And I am only left to assume it is because you fear the tsunami it could unleash in between the thighs of the woman you love most… ‘Yes Kapul, yes,’ she says.. ‘I can’t wait a minute longer Kapul.. Pound these thick cheeks with that Anaconda, Kapul.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Who is next? You, Judas, what is it you fear?”			
			“I fear being conned by Snakes who claim to know the Way,” he snipped back with a deadly spite.
			“And yet you have no awareness that You are the true con of your own narrative. Your mind is a fortress of fear, on a suicide mission to Prove… Always trying to Prove… For the man so enslaved in this hellish realm misses the Whole of Life, held captive by the claws of his own ego. He wants so desperately to be shaken, to be woken from his slumber but his pride is so booming and monstrous, it drowns outs every ringing bell.”
			“Kiss - my - ass - you old coon,” Judas spit back.
			The room froze. All eyes turned to The Master. His face was carved from stone—utterly devoid of any emotion. With a piercing calm, he hiked up his velvet pants, stepped to the edge of the stage, and dropped his old bones over the lip. He moved with purpose now—skirting around the rows of chairs like a serpent coiling its prey. With each footstep, the room seemed to shift. More force. More weight. More speed. Then he lurched—a full bodied surge—straight toward Judas, never breaking his searing gaze on the man for a second. The congregation of men were on edge of their seats. Their fear and awe of the moment hung in the air.. 
			With each step closer the Master came, Judas’s testicles shrank three millimeters. The muscles in his body began to clench so tightly they were on the verge of incineration. His gelled hair was so brittle you could hear the crackling and smoldering. 
			As the Master closed in, Judas began to shake violently. He squeezed his eyes shut and clenched at his guts, summoning every atom of strength not to shit himself… and then…  in the infinite silence and black of his mind, he felt something… in his ear… a deep penetration—slimy, turbulent, relentless. He whimpered in helpless agony as the walls of his canal were stretched and shredded. As the penetration came to its climax, he heard the pitched-down laughter and chanting of the men, and a faint robotic voice shout:
			“W E T   W I L L Y ! ! !”
			Judas crumbled. His body, his mind, his soul… violated and pillaged in slow motion, pumped and dumped by an ungodly force.
			“Judas, the fun is over. I have finished. Now Open - Your - Eyes,” The Master said softly.  
			With a pounding breath, Judas timidly cracked open his left eye. The Master grabbed him forcefully by the cheeks, and with his face mere centimeters from Judas’s, he commanded:
			“It is time to Wake Up my boy. You do not know why you came here today, but I do… You came for this moment. For this very. fucking. moment.”
			The Master let go of his cheeks and began to ease his face away from Judas’s ever so slowly. As the Master walked back to the stage he shouted buoyantly and clapped his hands.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">After fifty minutes, the van finally came to a halt and the doors swung open. By the bustling and busyness of the street outside it was clear they were in the downtown of a city, but anyone’s guess as to where exactly. 
			The federal agents grabbed the three men and yanked them out of the van. As they were steered into an old, brick building and prodded up a flight of stairs, the agents railed at them.
			“Move! Hurry it up, you fucking degenerates! We don’t have all day.”
			At the top of the stairs, the agents shoed them into a small, square room with plain white walls. Cameras in each corner stared down at them, poised to broadcast their images on the local late-night news as the most wicked and dangerous of men.
			The Head Fed followed the Master, Raul, and Gregory inside and shut the door behind them. In the middle of the room stood a black table and three brown envelopes, each tagged with their names. 
			“Gentlemen, inside each of these envelopes we have the official documentation and proof of each of your crimes. Now Mr. Davis won’t be going anywhere... but because I am an extremely forgiving man, I am going to give you two scoundrels one last opportunity to rebuke your crimes and agree to testify against Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.... and if you are willing to comply, you may go on your way,” the Head Fed said addressing Raul and Gregory. 
			“You heard the man. Do not be fools… my fate is already sealed, the show is over… go on your way,” said the Master.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Raul stared blankly at the check for a moment. Part of him was in disbelief, as if he had dreamed whole charade.. He ran his finger softly down the spine of the check and accepted the Moment for what it was… a blessing, a new beginning… another shot at Life and the Dream.
			 Raul walked over to the closet and began shuffling through stacks of old magazines. He stopped and pulled out a worn catalog: Janitorial Worldwide. Flipping through it quickly, he stopped on a page with a faded bookmark. On the marked page was a picture of a high-tech janitorial van. Inside the van was an entire array of state-of-the-art cleaning tools and machinery. 
			Raul pulled out his phone and dialed. It rang once, and then clicked over to a voice message.
			“Hello, this is Raul Delgado. I’d like to place an order for two SCV7’s... And if at all possible, I would like to have flaming vacuums painted on the sides of both… and my logo of course… Please call me at 323-457-8794.” 
			After hanging up, he retrieved the check off the table, slid it into his wallet—then paused. Something else caught his eye inside. He pulled out a small card, read the number, and dialed. It rang four times before a familiar voice snapped:
			“Who the fuck ca—" barked the voice—But before the man could finish he was steamrolled by the cool and impassioned Pimp Raul.
			“Yes boss. This is Raul Delgado from Lake Crest… yes, Raul... I’m aware it’s 2 A.M... I figured it is the hour your wife gets the most horney sir… and seeing as it is a sheer impossibility she could ever get to your little dick under all that disgusting, hideous flubber, I was wondering if I dropped by and gave her some real pipe, the pipe she dreams about all day long, if you wouldn’t consider a promotion and handsome raise for me sir?”
			Raul’s eyes glowed like a sacred fire. He had tapped fully into a flow state of Fearless Presence as he spoke,
			“Fired, sir? Kill me, sir? How dare you… I offer a favor, and this is how you repay me?!” 
			Raul hung up the phone and let out a primal wail of the most joyous laughter. It rang through the halls of his apartment like a war cry and an exorcism. Like a true Pimp, he slowly reclined back into his couch with a big old shit-eating grin stretched across his face. 				He was a man reclaiming his legend—the same legend buried in every man, burning to be Remembered. Some will hear the Call. Others will be taken for the Ride. But in the end, there is only One Real Question every man must answer: Are you a Pimp… or a bitch?</p>
