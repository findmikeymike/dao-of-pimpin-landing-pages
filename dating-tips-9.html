<p class="master">“But to take a woman on the Ride, to purposely manipulate… is that not pure deception? Is it not just more confusion in the world? A bid for the Shadow?’ interjected an astute and doubtful man.
			“Ah! A thinker walks among us! A fair and important question… Understand this my friend, sex is warfare, and some wars are inevitable. The very nature of the act itself is rooted in an act of aggression, and almost every move to get it, by man or woman—a subconsciously concocted manipulation. You drive a nice car to manipulate her perception of your status. She applies her cherry lipgloss to make you dream of her wet, juicy snatch. If men and women did not play this game, and did not find ways to attract and conquer each other, it would be the death of their species, so would it be fair to call this evil? If it takes some level of seduction for sex to ever occur, is it fair to damn the one who Understands versus the one who guesses or succeeds by happenstance? If it is somehow ‘evil,' it is clearly a necessary and natural one set in motion by the Almighty Pimp himself… Just know, for man, this game—this calculated behavior—is only temporary. When a man becomes a Pimp, there is no manipulation, no deceit necessary. Your essence, your mission, your passion will provide for the ultimate Ride in and of itself. You will not go cold at the zenith of your conversation with a beautiful woman out of tactic. You will go cold on her and pop back in two weeks later because there is something in your life of far greater importance. Her presence will become a genuine afterthought on your journey, and then, and only then, can her power over you be destroyed.” 
			“Master, how does one embark on this Path and still hold onto Himself, though?” barked a chubby man with a lisp.
			The Master’s head fell and shook gently side to side.
			“Hold on to Himself? Is ‘He’ not the cause of all your troubles, and exactly why you are here today? Should the three-hundred -pound woman with buffalo sauce on her blouse and thick black hairs running down her thighs—who showers once a season and complains about everything—just ‘be herself’ and expect you to love and chase her to the edge of the Earth? Enough with the Fairy Tales! The truth is ‘Who You Are’ in this moment, to a woman and the world alike, is of no interest or value, he brings no life or Feeling to the party. ‘He’ has never taken you anywhere in life but because you have gotten to know him so well, become so comfortable with him, you are afraid to leave him behind, and explore what lies Beyond. You must understand that your personality is nothing more than a collection of thoughts, feelings, and ideas from the past. It is an illusion, created to give you a false sense of identity and position in the world. You cling to it for safety and comfort—and it hinders you!” 
			“You hear that? An imaginary bag of shit floating in the wind! That’s all we are… how charming, ” snarled the dark eyed Judas.
			The Master continued as if Judas was invisible.
			“Your essence is fluid and ever-evolving. ‘Who You Are’ is whoever you Choose to be in any given moment. There are no boundaries to You, no limitations other than the ones you have carved into your Mechanical Mind. So I say to you, lighten up… enjoy the freedom, embrace the fluidity, have a little fun with ‘Yourself.’ Go try on some new personalities and behaviors, be the thing most unnatural to you. As you begin to let go of the identity you once gripped so tightly, you will notice a powerful thing start to happen: you will get a little looser, get a little more jive in your step… you will begin to notice how the world and women react differently to your Presence. You will start to realize the reason for those reactions, and the energy that truly moves the world… and this new You—not wasting all its energy and power trying to protect an ego or clinging to an idea, will have room for Presence and Magic. Soon enough this new state of Being will become as genuine and One with you as your original state of simpotry and stiffness once was. No fakery, no mystical lines necessary… The world will try its goddamn best to push back, make you cave, make you crawl back into your old shell, but you have drunk the sacred juice from the labias of the Almighty fountain, the Pimp has been born, and there is no going back… The Simp may be who you are, who you were, but he can easily be erased, and replaced with whomever it is you Choose. Even you, Mr. Finklefeet…” 
			Judas snickered and shook his head.
			“Master, for one who is very tied to his past, his ego.. who is self-admittedly close minded and rigid in identity, how can he go about separating from the old Him?” said a smokey voiced believer.
			“Think to the Method actor. Immerse yourself in someone Else. Go get yourself a cowboy hat, cowboy boots, some Levi denim and Marlboro Reds and go be the cowboy for a few days, or weeks, or months… Define Who he is and what makes him tick. Fully inhabit and operate as him throughout your day. Pick up your groceries as He… Make phone calls to women as He… become He in every last sense. Over time, as the line between You and He gets blurry, when you do not know which name to respond to, or you find yourself doing his hyena laugh, or holding a fork with the other hand, the idea of Who You Are will become less definite, more flexible… You will most likely find that right off the bat, you are far smoother and at ease with women and the world, as there will be no need to protect the ego you spent thirty years constructing. There will be a deep sense of liberation, and you may even find you enjoy your life more as the cowboy… or the Catholic priest, or the androgynous narcoleptic trucker, or whoever the hell it is that gives your spirit new Life.”
			As the Master sat back down in the lotus position and sipped his water, Raul saw a kaleidoscopic montage of himself as an array of eccentric characters swirling in his mind’s eye. He hopped from vision to vision, trying on different outfits and attitudes, inhabiting different worlds and socializing with all kinds of colorful characters. He remembered being twenty two and coming home one day in a black leather Harley jacket and how mercilessly Julia, his first wife, laughed at him. ‘Raul, you damn fool! Those jackets are made for hot bikers, not janitors. Did you get a kickstand for your mop, too?’ Raul hadn’t yet told her about his desire to get an old motorcycle, or his fantasies of the two of them taking late-night rides to escape the monotony of their days. He remembered the next afternoon, when he stuffed this vision into the pocket of the jacket and handed it back to the owner of the pawn shop, and the owner saying ‘Clutch gotcha huh?’… and the look of confusion and mild disgust on the man’s face when he replied, “The clutch of my wife.” And oddly, he felt a certain sense of peace with the memory. There was Somewhere in him that said maybe it wasn’t over… Maybe hidden under piles of Barbara Streisand vinyl and weary old lamp shades, in some dusty storage room of that pawn shop on Dunlevy Avenue, the tasseled Harley jacket would still be there, waiting for him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“She is not the enemy. She is just like me!” Shouted the men devoted men. 
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” yelled The Master.
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” chanted the choir. 
			“She shits and she does not always wash!”
			“She shits and she does not always wash!” they roared! 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“Very good,” said the Master. 
			“Hold tight to the mantra, men! The mantra is all we need!” shouted the chubby man with the lisp.
 			The Master threw his hand up in the air to halt the blossoming of a false notion.
			“No! For this is just the beginning! This is only one mantra, one practice, one compartment of the Mind. We will not stop here… We must eliminate not just the Web of the Woman, but every web you have ever spun!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“So he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself ‘the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,’ so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: ‘The first five rounds are on you.’ Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn’t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn’t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn’t for another two weeks—suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?”
			“I am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!” Gregory shouted without hesitation.
			“Yes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.’ This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of ‘losing’ some girl he doesn’t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.”
			“Sir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women… but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?” replied a curious believer.
			“No, no, no… you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I’m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from… a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call… I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot… there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself ‘How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?’ You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.”  
			“So I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?” replied the man.
			“No—on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection… for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp’s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man’s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">The Master stood and began to walk elegantly from one side of the stage to the other as he spoke.
			“Right now in this very moment there are millions of men all over the world shouting ‘that fucking savage bitch! How could she?!’ Oh the chumps, if they had any Understanding of Reality, they would be thanking the woman for leaving, as there are two main ways a woman exits a man’s life against his wishings, and both are a gift to the man. The first way is if the woman was no good, and did something unforgivable… She blew his cousin or lied about her entire past… in which case he thanks her for taking out the trash and freeing him from her depravity. The second way, the more tragic of the two, is when she leaves because the man is weak or has moved into his feminine and her attraction disintegrates to nothingness… and begrudgingly, he must thank her for shining a light on this weakness and the chinks in his armor. For the pain inflicted by her exit serves as a baptism by fire and inspires a growth in him. This is how the Aware man deals with these scenarios. Unfortunately, for the majority of men, still anchored in their Mechanical Minds, they blame her and the world and fall further into the abyss of impotence and lifelessness. It is for this reason that the average disgruntled man sees the woman as the enemy, as his adversary. He has no awareness that her role in his narrative is to aid the blossoming of the true Power in him, by any means necessary. He makes getting the woman and keeping her his mission, he becomes reactive and emotional, he moves fully into his Feminine, and this repels her.” 
			The Master stopped his pacing and turned to the men. He stared straight out at them and spoke earnestly.
			“The truth is that a woman does not want to be man’s Mission, she does not want to be the center of his universe, or the reason he gets out of bed in the morning... She may say it is so, but Understand, it is never, ever so.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory looked over at each other and burst into a hysterical, bewildered laughter. They were both feeling so many things in this moment... The Master had taken them on quite the Ride.
			“Twenty eight years we been running this same jig and every time it’s some bullshit! How many fucking choppers was that?! I said get two! Two! Not ten!” 
			The Master rattled off his cuffs and outstretched his arms as Buck moved to uncuff Raul and Gregory.
			“Hey, how about that ‘but but.. I’m black” bit?! Pretty damn good huh?!” chuckled the Master. 
			“It was very funny… a very nice touch Master. I swear your wit only gets sharper with age.” 
			The Master smiled a joyous smile. He turned to Raul and Gregory. 
			“Gentlemen, today has been quite the adventure… but this is just the beginning… you have taken the first step on a great journey… What you do from here is your own Choosing, it is of your own Will.. l am no longer of any use to you… as your hearts, and minds, and Mission will guide the way. I welcome you to the Path of the Pimp… Grab your envelopes off this table and go give life a good, hard fucking.” 
			The Master looked in Raul’s eyes and bowed his head. Then he looked in Gregory’s eyes and bowed his head. And with that, he grabbed his envelope off the table and began to sing “Fire and Rain” joyfully again as he sashayed out the door.				
			Raul and Gregory grabbed the brown manila envelopes tagged with their names, folded them down the center, shoved them in their pockets and headed out the door a moment behind The Master.  
			As they made their way out the front door of the building, Raul scanned the streets, expecting to get one last glimpse of the Master walking off into the distance, but the Master was nowhere in sight. As if by real Magic, the man had disappeared back into the mystical ether from which he first emerged.  
			As Raul pondered the mystery of the Master and surveyed the unknown world around him, he heard Gregory’s voice.
			“My brother… I guess there was room for two to walk the Path after all.”
			Raul looked back at Gregory with a warm smile. 
			“Yes… I suppose the Master’s tests and games knew no limit,” Raul responded. 
			“There’s a tavern at the end of this block, shall we start our journey with a drink?” said Gregory. 
			“I don’t think that’s a bad idea, my friend."</p>
