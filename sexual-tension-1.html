                <p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“We love you master! We shall meet you in Pussy Heaven!” 
			The Master’s disciples scurried eagerly out of the auditorium. There was a new world awaiting them. A world of pussy, and Magic, and foul smelling toilets… As Raul walked towards the exit, he savored the Master’s last words, and as he savored each of them, he was struck dead in his track. “A dame has called on me. I must go. A dame has called on me. I must go.” Master? Leave his Mission for the beckoning call of a woman? Leave men in the birthplace of true Understanding for a quick and trivial nut? Oh Raul! You were almost fooled! A test so obvious! Look at the energy and impatience of these men that walk beside you! They are in fantasy land! 
			Raul turned and started back towards the stage. There were a handful of perceptive men who had not left their chairs. Raul reclaimed his seat next to Gregory, one of the few Unmovable devotees. Gregory leaned in to him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Master you speak oft of the Mission, the purpose of man, but truth be told I do not understand what this concept is really about. What is a man like me to do with himself, as surely a woman will sense I am mission-less?” said the pudgy lispy man.
			“First of all, know that your logic is not just backwards on a surface level, it is broken at its core. Man does not take on the Mission or pursue purpose to amuse or lure a woman. The woman literally has nothing to do with this. We will get back to the woman but know  this… man takes on the Mission for himself, and for his own evolution. So let us start by understanding first what Mission truly is and why it is imperative to every man’s journey. Listen to me closely... the Mission is the vessel for man’s evolution… on the mission, man throws himself into the the world of the unknown, to a space beyond his understandings, and outside the boundaries and limitations of mundane human “existence.” It is in the great rapids and storms of this world where the ordinary, Mechanical Mind is plundered and shattered as man moves from a state of passivity to Action.. He moves from a place of merely Existing, and reacting to the world around him—to Being, where he becomes the Action behind the world around him. He transforms from an observer of life to a Creator of life… from the Field to the Force... It is in this transformation that he Realizes many great Truths: that he is not ‘in’ the world, the world is in him. His life is not chaos or coincidence, it is of his making and his alone! For this is the great creative force the Almighty Pimp has bestowed upon man. Do you follow?’
			The congregation of men nodded in unison.
			“On the Mission, a man is tested over and over again as to whether he truly Understands these things, for if he does, he will never balk or surrender at the obstacles and set backs along the Way, as he is aware they are all of his own creation and immaculately placed opportunities he has created to prove himself to Himself! He becomes aware of his narrative and the archetypes around him. He sees the femme fatale clear as day, using her tight waist and big knockers to try to lore him back into the patterns of the lower, Mechanical Mind. He recognizes the Mentor, the unlikely figure offering wisdom and clues to his further evolution. He goes to war with his own Fear, the true Villain of his story… And with each progressive chapter of his journey, the Mechanical Mind begins to crumble and give way to the New Mind… For this is the evolution from man to Pimp.”
			“But Sir... I craft sandwiches at a local sub shop,” the pudge replied.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Sammy Davis Jr., you are under arrest by the Federal Police of Justice for high crimes of the many. You have the right to remain silent as I hereby announce these crimes. Under the newly passed Federal Women’s Protection Act, in effect April 16th, pursuant code 769BBC, “Pimping" in all of its forms comes with a life sentence… The crimes you have committed under the umbrella of this law include: One… Unlawful disclosure of the Woman’s Psychology. Two… Manipulation of Historical Sexual Dynamics. Three… Radicalizing and Sexually Weaponizing Males. Four… Collecting money in Women Endangering Pursuits… last but not least, Five— using the word “Faggot” and “bitch” among other terms deemed unlawful. We have all of this on tape.” 
			The Master dropped his head and began to sob. 
			“But… but... I’m Black?" he whimpered.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>
