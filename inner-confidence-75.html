                <p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“We are gathered here today to solve a riddle as old as time. You can thank Adam— for when he first slid his crooked finger into the soft, warm slit of Eve, he set in motion the Eternal Conundrum of Man and a millennia of madness.. You have ensnared yourself in the Trap of all traps, and yet you have no idea of your own captivity. You came today with childish questions of pussy-piping and pick up lines, and it’s my lone hope that when you leave today, you will leave with something else entirely… And it will not be answer you came looking for. In fact, it will be a question.. The One Real Question… Neither I, nor Saint Peter himself has the answer for you. For it was you, and only you that created this mess, and it is you and only you who has the power to see your way out of it…” 
			A middle aged Pakistani man with a pitiful mustache raised his hand. Before being addressed, and with his hand still raised awkwardly, he rose and spoke in a thick Indian accent.
			“But sir, I did not pay to hear philosophical musings. I was told you could teach me how to fuck on college girls and find a good wife.”
			“Fuck on college girls you may Kapul, find a wife you may… but if and only if you come to Understand the Truth… women, dating, fucking… these are a symptom, a mere by-product of Pimping. They are not the Mission. They are the ice cold cups of Gatorade waiting for you at the pit-stops on the marathon of life… on the real Mission at hand… If it is only sex with beautiful women you desire Kapul, then find the Master of Commerce, take a seminar, make yourself a small fortune, and go to a whore house… but I challenge you to ask yourself after the first load you spew, if that was ‘It,’ if that pop was the truest desire of your heart. For the True Desire of man never falters or retreats. It is always there, calling…”
			“But what could possibly be better than some good snatch Master?!” interjected the Indian man. The other men agreed. 
			“You are a mouse in a closet looking for cheese. A mouse with no awareness to the vastness of the house you live in. A mouse that could never even fathom a journey to the other side of the neighborhood. A mouse that could never understand the fact that the neighborhood is but a mouse to the city, the city a mouse to the nation, and the nation a mouse to Earth. Are you such a fool that you spent 4,000 dollars and flew from India to learn of the cheese in the closet? Lower your arm. Sit down.”
			“Sir… I was born in Georgia,” muttered the Pakistani man.
			“I enjoy cheese. Greatly, sir. My uncle owns a pizza parlor in Brooklyn. So you will teach us nothing of women? Please teach us of women, Master,” interjected a man who wanted to Believe.
			“I will teach you about women and the simple form of pimping as you know it to be, as conquering The Woman is the central battle in all of your narratives, and the greatest hurdle to your evolution. Her and her sweet titties and her sharp tongue, they are the center of your Universe. She sends fear up your spine, and electricity through your little dick. She makes your voice shake, and your knees weak. She takes one look at another man, and crushes your fragile soul. She must be conquered…”
			The men perked up, ready to receive and savor every word of esoteric wisdom the Master had in store.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Let us start at the beginning: You simps open your mouth to speak to a woman, and she is not moved. Hell, she’s usually appalled. She looks into your eyes and the fiery goddess deep within her subconscious immediately recognizes: this man does not Understand. This man does not know The Way. He is weak and confused, fearful and timid, he has no true life-force, no Presence or Awareness of this Great Unfolding and his journey will be no Ride… You hit her with your crafty lines and your bad boy smirk you practiced in the mirror for twelve hours, and little do you know, you have made the original mistake. You spoke to her in a language she does not speak. Your words have fallen on deaf ears.” 
			The Master raised his voice.
			“The true language of a woman makes not a sound. The true language and currency with a woman—and all humans for that matter—is Emotion. It is Feeling… And while there are many shades of emotion, many hues, there are only two true and primal emotions: Love and Fear. It is love and fear that cause the indescribable thump in her chest, the sweat in her palms. The little league player knows how to make her feel loved, the division one player knows how to deal her a bit of fear and anxiety, but the Pimp knows that it is neither love nor fear that truly fills the deepest yearnings of a woman’s soul.”
			The Master leaned forward and paused for a beat. He spoke slowly, with great intention. 
			“It is The Ride… the ride from love to fear, from fear to love, that ignite her bones and dampen her labias. It is in the Movement between these internal worlds that the power lies. It is The Ride that awakens her being, and reminds her that she is Here, Now… that something is Happening—and that she’s a part of it. It is The Ride, the exhilarating emotional journey, that she truly yearns, that she seeks.”
			The Master eased back into his default posture.
			“So when we talk about engaging with a woman, connecting with a woman, attracting a woman, banging the shit out of a woman, this is the language we are speaking, the language of Feeling. It is the cinder and soot the castle is built upon.”
			A skeptical man with slicked back hair, a gaudy satin shirt, and dark eyes snickered. He made sure his mockery of the Master was loud enough for all to hear.
			“Ha! Our words do not matter? A man can say ‘anything?’ A solid pick-up line cannot capture a woman?! Gimme a break!” scoffed the skeptical man with dark eyes.
			“My brooding Casanova, have these pre-rehearsed lines ever worked for you?” the Master snapped back.
			“My ‘name’ is Judas Finkleberry, and yes, in fact they do work. I have spent time with a ‘True’ Master, one who has given me a sequence of Words that can have even the most strident feminist butt-fucking-naked and begging for it in twenty minutes flat,” sneered the cynical Judas. 
			There were audible gasps from the men. The Master was tickled.
			“Oh is that so, Mr. Finklebobby? And I gather that is why you are here with us today? Because your incantations and spells are so potent with the woman?” replied the Master calmly.
			“Four words is all it takes…” said Judas with a scowl.
			“Get in my Ferrari!” jested the Master.
			The congregation of men snickered. Raul looked to Judas and sensed a heavy, metallic vibe about the man, as if he had been hurt by the world, and vowed to return the hurt by any means necessary. The Master turned his attention back to the believers. 
			“Let us proceed. And if The Dao proves false, we’ll all pitch in and pay our dear Judas for the real Magic. Deal?”
			The collective of men nodded in agreement.
			“What I am saying is that your words are only as useful as the Feelings they carry, a shell to transmit the real Language and Magic. The weight they hold is but a fart in the wind in comparison to the energy and emotion you create simply from your Presence. I am telling you that you can say damn near anything to a woman, yes damn near anything, and if You and your essence are in the right space, holding a certain Presence and ease, it will Move a woman far more than Mr. Finklebottom and his four sacred words. I’m saying that the energy and sound of your voice alone carry far more weight than the words that fall from the tongue.”
			The misanthropic Judas shook his head and looked at the Master with venom in his beady eyes. The Master paid no mind to his hostility and continued.
			“You are always asking what to say to a woman, and I’m telling you it is the wrong question. The reason you and ninety seven percent of men struggle so much with women is because you are eternally missing the forest for the trees. You are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. You have been walking around for damn near your entire life like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to figure out the mysteries of the woman, and every where you turn, someone else equally as confused is there to point you in the wrong direction.”
			“But Master how does one learn to speak this sacred language?” said a zealous man. 
			“How does one learn how to do anything? He studies very closely the one who does. You have seen men all your life who had that magic touch with women, but you were watching for all the wrong things. You assumed it must have been his classic smile or the tangerine scent of his cologne… I’m telling you to not just watch the man, but Feel him.. feel his jive, his ease, the rhythm he speaks at, the color he uses to describe the world around him.. I’m telling you to watch yourself, and your own emotions.”
			The Master stood up and began to pace the stage smoothly and slowly.
			“Imagine for a moment, you are speaking with a woman that by some strange glitch in the matrix does take interest in you, and you are going back and forth in swift digital conversation, and you are sure you’ve it in the bag, already picked out the fresh denim you are going to wear when you meet her, and the first surface in the house where you plan to make love to her, and then all sudden THWAP… crickets… She’s gone. Missing in action. Nowhere on the face of the mother fucking Earth to be found… What is it you feel? You feel the Fear. You fear you must have said something wrong, you fear your last line was not clever enough. You fear she met someone that was More than you… You were in the space of love, and excitement, and anticipation… and now in the blink of your god damn eye, all of that is gone, and all that’s left is fear. She has taken you for The Ride, and like a flaming bag of shit on the doorstep of your poor soul… you can’t look away. You can’t stop thinking about it. It gnaws at you and ignites something in you. You feel anger at yourself for another botch. And then out of no where, the bitch is back! She has risen like Christ! And she tells you she was just ‘caught up with some things and that her aunt had surgery’ and asks you ‘How are you’, and what do you feel? You feel the love again! You feel relieved it was not some idiotic thing you said. You feel excited you might still get to do some fuckin.. maybe even fall in love.. But then… as you obsessively re-read your conversation to get reacquainted with the dynamic and where you left off, you notice those three god forsaken little words: “How. Are. You.” and you start to get a funny feeling in your stomach. How am I? How - am - I? What happened to the heat and the romance? I address the goddamn Postman with more passion than that… The woman went from paragraphs of nonsense and emojicons, to those three lifeless little words… And now all the sudden, it’s the blink of an eye later, and she’s given you the the Pimp Special.. she’s taken you on the Round Trip… You felt the warm tingles of bliss running up your spine and in a single instant, kapoof—the tingles were gone, and you were riding the lightening 2,000 miles per hour straight back to the land of Fear…”
			The Master’s pace picked up speed as he continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">The Master set his cup back down on the floor and cracked his knuckles. As the old bones in his fingers crunched, he exhaled deeply. 
			Gregory raised his hand and again, began to speak before being addressed.
			“Sir, if there is one thing that truly confuses me, it is the age old battle of the ‘nice guy’ and the ‘asshole’.. Can you tell us once and for all if it’s true that the nice guy finishes last and the asshole gets the snatch? My cousin Aadesh says I fail with the ladies because I am a nice guy and a pussy.”
			“The asshole, the nice guy… again your Mechanical Mind is just looking for molds and systems to make sense of the world, to make sense of culture. The goal is something Else entirely… the goal is to embody the fluidity and clarity of the Pimp. Besides, we must know it is not the label or name we give something that makes it What It Is. Every man in this room may call you Kapul, but what does it matter to you if your birth certificate says Gregory?” 
			“I understand, Master. But would you not agree in the simplest sense, in terms of one's attitude, it is better to inhabit the spirit of the asshole as opposed to the nice guy?” 
			“It is not the asshole that has value to the woman. You are conflating the jeweler with the diamonds held in his pockets. In the pocket of the asshole, you will find boldness, confidence, a strong Will, strict boundaries of what he will and will not tolerate, a mind that values its time and energy, a fearless demeanor when facing the world and all foes, a man who gives no fucks for the opinions of others, a man who seeks no validation from a woman... And why are these qualities enticing to the woman?”
			“They show strength, Master,” Gregory replied.
			“Yes strength, obviously… but press deeper.”
			The Master paused for a moment hoping for an answer. He continued.
			“They create emotion! Emotion! Emotion!… they set the woman off on a electrifying inner-journey as she tries to capture the unattainable… and this is why assholes generally do well with women, but in regards to his success, it is these qualities alone that move the woman. Know that a man can have these qualities without being cruel or ugly. Imagine a man with these qualities pushing an innocent elderly woman down the escalator at the mall and high-fiving his friend. How many women are lined and up and begging to lay him?”
			“None,” the congregation of men agreed. 
			The Master nodded and continued.
			“And as for the nice guy… he is despised by women and the world because he cannot be trusted. His ‘niceness’ is almost always a ploy to get something he wants but is too weak to take. He offers no emotion or Magic because he is so selfishly consumed in his own world and what it is he wants, and how others perceive him to ever step in anyone else’s world. Now ask yourself, are you He? The man so self-consumed with being liked and unoffensive to others that he lacks all Presence?” 
			The men pretended to ponder the question, knowing damn well they were He.
			“So if a man wants to be decent, and has some ethics, where does that leave him sir?”
			“Beyond! Beyond the asshole and the nice guy. Know that one can be simultaneously decent, and give of himself to the world and his fellow man, and still be bold and badass, still slay a beast at the drop of a hat, still tease the shit out of a woman and clap her cheeks in the bathroom at the local diner before the pancakes arrive. This is the way of the Pimp. He exists in a league of his own creation.”
			“Master, I will admit I am the ‘nice guy’ type, for sure. To better understand, can you explain how this plays out in the real life interaction between men and women?” said a zealous man in the front row. 
			“When men and women are together, there is always some subtle aspect of sex lurking… the polarities of the masculine and feminine have this draw towards each other ingrained. When you are with a woman you have no attraction to, or a woman is with a man she has no attraction to, this draw of polarities recedes and may be more or less extinguished, and the two can carry on as friends or associates... but when there is an attraction there, on a subconscious level or conscious level, or both simultaneously, these energies begin to Dance. And what is this Dance? It is the motion, the push and pull, the tension of these two energies moving together rhythmically, side to side, but also forward in direction.. and where is it moving forward towards? Where does it lead?”
			The Master waited for a response, but the men had none. They were still trying to put it all together. He continued.
			“The nice guy is not even aware of the Dance’s existence, and because he is not aware of it on a conscious level, there is no chance for sex to happen, as it takes the conscious aspect of the Dance to fuel the interaction forward towards sex and union. He is so consumed with coming across pleasantly and making a good impression, that there is no action, no tension, no Magic… only reaction to both the woman and the world around him. He is soft and flaccid, and as he inhabits this frame of being the reactor, the receiver, more passive in nature, he has moved fully into the Feminine like the woman. And naturally, like everything under the sun, Universal Law says these energies of the same vibration will repel. The woman says 'My! This beer tastes like urine!’ The man who chose and ordered them yelps ‘Why yes they do my lady! Just terrible! My apologies—let me get us another round.’ The woman says ‘I can’t get enough of this band playing tonight!’ The man, who knows the music is shit, replies ‘Oh my god! They’re so good right?!’ She asks him if he ‘always gels his hair like that?’ and unaware as to whether her comment is a compliment or a cutdown, he assumes the worst and becomes anxious, ‘Well… no… I... just here and there I guess… but it probably looks better when it’s dry... I don’t know?’ For the man is telling the truth, he does not have any conviction in his hair, or anything else in life.”
			Judas discretely tapped at his gelled top to feel the placement and status of his hair. He quietly looked to the men next to him to see if they noticed, but their eyes were glued on the Master. 
			“Towards the end of this dreadful night, they sit at a table by the bar, and a moment of silence begins to blossom and the man, terrified of the Void, thrusts his voice forward, ‘So... when are you free next? I’ve had a great time and would love to see you again.’ The woman’s face contorts as she tries her best to camouflage every fiber of her being cringing in agony. She replies ‘Hmm… I’m not too sure. I have a lot going on the next couple weeks but let’s keep in touch.’ Do you see how pathetic and soul-crushing this scene is? Are you aware that this man has a better shot at hitting the Mega-Millions than bedding or dating this woman? Do you understand that if this man had simply inversed every word, every look, every move he made tonight, he would have faired far better by default? This is why I am telling you that if every one of your interactions with women plays out the same way, there is something much deeper that needs to be addressed in You.”
			“Sir, it appears you have been eaves dropping on my dates!” remarked one of the converted men playfully. 
			“Hell! Mine too! Now tell us of the Pimp, Master,” chimed another enthusiastic man.
			“As for the Pimp, his night with the same woman looks very different, so much so that if the other man saw it unfold, he would have no clue as to what was Unfolding and would not believe his eyes. The Pimp sets a date with the woman at a bar a five minute walk from his house, as the location makes certain possibilities much more... possible. He’s also aware of the edge he has socially in this atmosphere as it is his ‘home court.’ And because he’s a bit preoccupied finishing a Python code he has been working on all week, tending to his true calling in life, he unintentionally shows up thirteen minutes late. He approaches the table casually, in a pair of old jeans and a nondescript t-shirt, with no apparent anxiety over his tardiness.. and as he takes a seat next to the woman, she says to him ‘Well well well, nice of you to have shown up. I was about to leave,’ and the man replies ‘Oh cut me some slack… I was getting all done up for you.' Notice the subtle push: he shows up late with no remorse, and the pull: he jokes that it was only because he was trying to impress her. An obvious fib and tease that simultaneously disarms her ego, mocks flattery, and reasserts the ‘Man to Woman’ sexual dynamic established in their initial communications. She can sense immediately that this man knows how to Dance and that he is not going to be like the last seven impotent schlubs she went out with. He immediately presents some level of challenge to her. Are you with me?”
			The congregation of men nodded in unison. They were fully enthralled, as if for the first time seeing behind a curtain into a hidden world they knew existed but never understood.
			The Master carried on.
			“A few minutes later, a feisty young lady the man has dated in the past drunkenly approaches the table and says ‘Look who it is? Does your parole officer know you’re here?’ The silly young lady, not understanding her own breed’s psychology, thinks her comment will act as some sort of quasi cock-block to the man, but only adds fuel to the fire… the emotional landscape of the woman sitting next to him is now ablaze with curiosity and intrigue. She also feels a subtle tinge of jealousy in the left side of her gut, as her keen intuition tells her these two have definitely slept together. The man sets down his drink and in no rush responds to the young drunk lady ‘Luckily he is of no concern.. twenty bucks goes a long ways these days.’ The young drunk lady stands frozen. She has been outwitted and her attack, vaporized. She stares at him for a moment, and he is unmoved. She is out of ammunition, accepts defeat, and stumbles off into the night. ‘Parole?’ his date playfully jeers. ‘Only petty crimes, mostly harmless,’ the man replies… And why does he respond in this manner?”
			“Because he knows that the straight answer holds no Magic or Feeling,” Raul retorted.
			The Master grinned and shook his fist with mirth.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“My friend… I was going to come retrieve you, but I knew with certainty you would Realize. I did not want to steal that moment from you. I am glad you have returned.” 
			Raul grabbed Gregory’s shoulder. 
			“Let the journey continue, brother.”
			 1,250 men down, only ten remained.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">As Raul stood to his feet he had a great realization: this moment had nothing to do with the Master, the men, the agents, or the Law. The film playing out before his eyes was his own creation, and the scene at hand an opportunity he had created to prove himself to Himself. And with that great realization something cracked in his mind, and for the first time in many years he felt Alive again. He could feel the blood in his veins and swelling of his testicles as he stared the Head Fed right in the eye... 
			“This man has done no evil! Especially not on behalf of the woman! For he has only taught of what her soul truly yearns, and for that which our own souls yearn as well! I stand by everything that has taken place here today!” Raul shouted.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">Raul reached into the bottom of the envelope and felt something tucked inside. In the bottom left corner was a small, neatly folder square of paper.. Raul pulled it out and unfolded it. It was a check.</p>
