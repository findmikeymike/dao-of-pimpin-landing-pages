                <p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“You missed a spot,” he snarled. 
			Raul’s blood began to boil. He had a fleeting vision of cracking the man over the head with the handle of his mop and flushing his remains down the toilet. It was not the first time he had been treated with such disrespect and contempt by his boss, but it was the most brash, and as infuriated as he was in the moment, there was a part of him that felt it was deserved. You are thirty-eight years old Raul! And this is how you spend your precious life? Cleaning toilets and replacing light bulbs for barbarians! Slaving away for pennies! It’s been twenty years now, Raul! Get it together!
			There was a more hopeful time in Raul’s life when he did have a Dream. He had grand and lucid visions of his very own janitorial company, ‘Delgado’s Diligent Cleaning.’ The most esteemed and prestigious cleaning service in all of Little Rock. Raul could see in vivid, crystallized color a satellite view of his vans crawling on every corner of the city. He saw people at stop lights giving the thumbs up to his workers and the occasional woman flashing her bosoms in the front yard as he passed in the ‘Boss Van’. He saw warm, pink suds soaking into terminally ill carpet, and a time-lapse of their resuscitations to a youthful vigor. 
			But as the gears of the galaxy churned on, and the years passed, and the hell-raising women crept in the cracks of his sad life to tap the last of his blood, the color and clarity of Raul’s visions faded away, leaving behind only the carcass of a Dream.. a pile of bones and a few shreds of dried meat. He needed a win in life, something… anything... to give him a bit of faith and keep him Going. 
			Raul pulled out of the Lake Crest parking lot and  floored it. His ’87 Volvo shrieked and wailed as it barreled down the open road, rattling maniacally as it surged to its top speed. The odometer read thirty-eight miles per hour. With the motel and all of its horror finally out of sight, Raul dug into his pocket, pulled out the mystical notecard, and placed it in his lap. He gently stroked the card with his thumb, over and over, as if to ensure its secrets would not escape. The cars behind him on the single lane road beeped in agony, just as they always did. “Forget them, Raul! Stay focused… You may just be holding the ticket to a new life, Raul!” he thought to himself. In four short days, he would have his answer.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I too stand by the Master.. I too am guilty of pursuing the Path of the Pimp—and I shall pursue it every day until death!” Gregory roared. 
			There was a heart and fullness in his voice, a depth and conviction he, nor anyone else on Earth had ever heard materialize from within him before. 
			The bitch men looked on in astonishment. As they stood on the left side of the room as “free men,” there was a part of all of them that Understood they were witnessing something special Unfolding— something that they couldn’t quite put their finger on, something their Mechanical Minds just couldn’t fully compute. 
			The agents closed in on Raul and Gregory, threw them to the ground violently, and cuffed them.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">Raul the Pimp, 		Let the contents of this envelope serve you on 
	The Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">Raul reached into the bottom of the envelope and felt something tucked inside. In the bottom left corner was a small, neatly folder square of paper.. Raul pulled it out and unfolded it. It was a check.</p>
