<div class="master-student-dialogue">
<p class="student">Master, I see others who have mastered success. What's their secret?</p>
<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>
