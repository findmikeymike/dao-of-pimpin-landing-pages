                <p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, so there is some passion there, some curiosity… Some juice to the endeavor beyond the pay… You want to feed your fellow man, and the focus and essence of what you do is in the Creation and giving of something of substance to the world. Then by god, make the best fucking sandwiches the world has ever tasted! Step in that shop every day with the mindset that there is the possibility of the Unknown happening… create a space for the magic and step into it! No preconceived notions, no mental scripts or limitations! You love sauces, oh?!”
			“I fucking love them sir. A good sauce is like a good woman. Hard to find and in limited supply,” replied the pudgy adept.
			“Then stay an hour late every day for an entire year, mixing the sauces and rubs in different combinations and proportions until you have stumbled on a sauce like no other! A sauce so zesty and delicious it sends a shiver down the spine! Toss and turn in your bed in the late hours of the night deliberating on the best name for your sauce and how you are going to deliver it to every tongue on Earth! Make the most beautiful sandwich you have ever made, lather it with your Magic Sauce and present it to your boss… and when he takes that first bite, and his eyes roll back into his head in ecstasy, you tell him, “My special sauce sir, The Magic Sauce! I have spent a year on this and I would love your blessing in adding it to the menu!” And how will he respond?”
			“He’ll love it! He’ll say it’s genius!” shouted the man excitedly.
			“No! He will not! For his Mechanical Mind will tell him that your sauce may steal his thunder, and encroach on his power over the shop! So what will you say to him?”
			“I will say but sir—’’
			“You will say nothing to him! To bloody hell with him! He will not stop the Sauce! And so you offer it to customers when he is not there… and soon enough when everyone in that sandwich shop is lining up for your goddamn sauce and the big man gets hip to the jig and fires your ass, you smile to yourself knowing that your first set-back, the first test of your Will, means you are on the right track. So you press on… you take your earnings and buy the ingredients in bulk, and start concocting it at home… until your entire refrigerator is stocked with ‘The Magic Sauce.’ You go door to door, giving samples to people and selling your sauce… And soon enough folks are emailing the local paper about the young guy selling his sauce door to door, and the paper writes an article… the local market asks you if they can sell your sauce… and now, like an alchemist, you have transformed a mundane job and life in the sandwich shop into something More, into a Mission! And with each hurdle and each mini victory, your heart will sing and your mind will start looking at all the impossibles as Possible. You will start to see your life and destiny through a new lens. This is what puts blood in a man’s veins and a shine in his eyes. Is this a pursuit you are Ready for my boy?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“I understand that may be the case Master, but I must admit, no amount of logic or reasoning seems to dull the pain. I still am absorbed in the pain. It is unwavering.. and I cannot see myself with anyone else but her... how can one deal?” 
			“Again you are only living in the truth of the Now, of the emotion you feel in this very moment. And those emotions will fade and morph into new emotions in time. Can you acknowledge this?”
			“Yes. Yes I understand, sir,” replied the sorrowful man.
			“Let’s start with addressing the core feeling you are left with: aloneness. You imagine that gut wrenching heartbreak you feel is unlike anything anyone else on this Earth could ever imagine. But you must know it is an ignorant and arrogant thought... Almost every single person you pass on the street has felt that same all-consuming pain. They have lost someone they held just as dear, yet there they are, marching on… many of them with new partners or love interests. I want you to look at every one of those people, really look at them, and know they came out the other side, and your fate will be the same. With this simple awareness in the mind let's move on to the real work: cutting out the web and imprint this woman has left behind.”
			The Master rubbed his hands together and rolled his neck.
			“Just as you have spun your webs of fear, you have spun a web with this woman. I want you to sit down at a table with a pen and pad... go back in your mind to the very first girl you ever loved or had a passionate crush on… all the way back.. It may have been kindergarten or 2nd grade. Now, write down her name. Go through all the years of your life, and write down all the names. Don’t skip a single love or infatuation.. You should have fifteen, thirty, fifty names on your list. At the bottom, the last name you will add to the list is the one who just broke you. Now starting with the very first name on the list, the very first girl you loved… I want you to see her in your mind’s eye. There are borders framing this memory of her... push on the boarders of this memory, look outside the frame. Step all the way in it, remember the way she smelled, and the tone of her voice... feel that rush of life and love you felt when you were near her... the tingle that ran up the back of your neck when you sat next to her in math class and your arms brushed lightly upon each others. Remember how much you loved her, and how in the moment you could have never imagined feeling that way about any other girl. When you are fully submerged in the feeling, when all that Magic has hit you again, let it fade. Step back outside the memory and back to the now. Watch as all that passion, all that love, the whole trip dissolves back into the nothingness of the Now. Go through every name on your list and repeat the process. Notice the world of love and emotion you had for each woman and how with time and each new Love Trip, the prior woman faded into oblivion. Now look at the last name on the list, the one who just broke you, and See that she is just another name on the list. Know that like all the others, her influence on your emotional state is destined to fade and give way to a new name. See the whole thing, the whole list for what it is: an emotional Trip. Realize that each name is but an emotional oasis in a desert of the mundane. Look at that list and ask yourself: what is this? What is this about? Is this evolving list of romantic entanglements ‘It’? Is this the highest pursuit of a man’s life?”
			The Master paused, and tilted his head.
			“That is not a rhetorical question. Is this man’s greatest pursuit?!”
			“No!” they shouted.
			“Should this impermanent dance be the center of my universe and dictate the way I live and operate? Man must ask himself if he wants to spend his short and fragile life hunting for the cheese in the closet or pushing Beyond... evolving his spirit… if this was all just about women and pussy, you could be falling in love and screwing your brains out in a whore house right now… I think each of you is aware by now that mastery with women is just a symbol, a metaphor for a bliss and conquering of Something much Greater in your life.”
			“The pain aside, how does one deal with the betrayal? The idea of my girl being penetrated by another man… it haunts my dreams,” exclaimed the heart-broken man.
			“Let’s first look at this Fear very closely. You are afraid of your woman going to bed with another man. The idea of another man penetrating your little pumpkin pie is like a knife in your gut. But why? What about this scene is so haunting? You’re well aware she has most likely had an army of penises inside her before you were together? And those cause you no agony? So we can deduce from this logic that it is not the idea of another man penetrating your woman that is the issue. The issue is her taking another man’s penis after You were there. And if we prone a bit more we find that the real Fear is that some man after you will be More than you. He will be more charismatic, or more talented, or better looking, or have a bigger pipe.. And because there is a chance he is More, you feel less than... you feel inferior, inadequate, weak, unlovable.. So the heart of this matter isn’t in her or him, or his penis inside of her… it lies in you, and the way you feel about and perceive yourself. Know this fear will not cease, the nightmares will not cease, until something major has changed in You. Now we could give you more systems, more practices, another mantra to help cut this web from the mind, but you men must realize by now, the webs you have spun are endless, and it is going to be on you to use the blueprint and framework of our prior practices to guide your way.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">One by one, the men sheepishly rose to their feet. The pudgy man with a lisp began to cry as he dragged himself towards the left side of the room.
			 Judas stood and looked to the Master, hoping to see him regain the Power in his eyes and essence, but the Master’s head remained down. He felt a deep sense of sadness and betrayal. Amid all the chaos and trials of the day, he had somehow come to believe in The Master, and trust he knew The Way. As much as his feet detested, he dropped his chin and shuffled over towards the group of “free men.”
			Raul laid on the ground, frozen in time, his mind raced back and forth in a whirlwind. There was a ringing in his ear, and a muffled voice shouting through all the noise and winds of emotion, and as he concentrated on the voice everything became still and silent… and he heard the Master say:</p>
