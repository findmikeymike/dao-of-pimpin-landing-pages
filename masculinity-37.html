                <p class="student">Master, I've been struggling with authenticity. Can you share your wisdom on this?</p>

<p class="master">Exactly twenty two minutes later the Master reemerged onto the stage. This time doing a little sashay to the center. He sat back down in lotus position, rubbed his hands together and spoke with a mischievous grin. 
			“The Master takes his medicine, and relieves himself and twenty men disappear? Tsk Tsk.. It is not their time. And it may not be yours either, but know that just by still being seated, Here... in this moment... there is something Alive and Aware in you. For you are learning to see through the simple deceptions and tests of the world, and you are operating with stillness and patience. It is these characteristics that make the Pimp so smooth, so crafty, so capable...” 
			“Master speak more to of us of stillness and patience,” said Raul.
			“Stillness, patience.. these are qualities of a man moving beyond the Mechanical Mind who realizes in the physical sense, there is nowhere Here to go.. no reason to race past the cars on the street only to sit next to them at the red light a mile ahead. Now let’s speak on these qualities in regard to your relations with the woman. The average man receives a message from a woman he is conversing with, and what does he do? First, he thinks to himself ‘I have seen enough YouTube videos to know I must wait a bit before I respond, as I would not want to come across as needy.’ Six minutes in and the Fear starts to knock at his chest, ‘but if I wait any longer, maybe another man may snatch her attention.’ Approximately eight minutes after receiving her message, he responds with some half-witted tease that has no Magic or direction, for he has no idea where he is even taking this woman. The slightly stronger man, he responds in seventeen minutes. His message has a semblance of direction and Magic, and is just enough to warrant another casual response as she continues to test the water with the most base level of curiosity and bask in the validation of his attention. But what about the Pimp? Where is the Pimp in all of this and what the hell is he up to?”
			“He’s going to pound town on the triplets he met at the Walgreens! Ain’t he Master?” hooted the pudgy man. 
			The master dismissed the man’s juvenile remark with a wave of his hand.
			“The pimp is busy slaying the real dragon. He doesn’t even see her message until the next day. When he does, he reads it—along with seven other messages from similar women—and begins to scan for the woman that has a high level of interest, and knows how to Dance.. the one who is alive and present, and returns Magic with Magic. But then… there is a ring at the doorbell, so he drops the phone and the women and runs to the door. On his step is a mysterious package.. the one he has been anticipating! So he takes the package and scurries down into his basement... In the corner of the basement is a make-shift laboratory with shelves full of strange chemicals and glass beakers. The man rips open the package, throws on his goggles and shouts, ‘Pfizer said it couldn’t be done! Moderna said it was light years away! But nay! One man discovered the elixir in his basement! The first and only true cure for Swamp Ass is on its way!’ He stays entranced in his chemistry for the next four days straight, and emerges with a smile on his face, for he has made another inch of progress on the thousand mile journey. ‘My my what a victory.. I could really go for a cold gatorade and a recharge!’ he says to himself.”
			The Master arched his head back and simulated big gulps from a bottle. He wiped his head and continued.</p>
