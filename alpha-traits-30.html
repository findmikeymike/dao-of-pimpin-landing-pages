<p class="master">“We are gathered here today to solve a riddle as old as time. You can thank Adam— for when he first slid his crooked finger into the soft, warm slit of Eve, he set in motion the Eternal Conundrum of Man and a millennia of madness.. You have ensnared yourself in the Trap of all traps, and yet you have no idea of your own captivity. You came today with childish questions of pussy-piping and pick up lines, and it’s my lone hope that when you leave today, you will leave with something else entirely… And it will not be answer you came looking for. In fact, it will be a question.. The One Real Question… Neither I, nor Saint Peter himself has the answer for you. For it was you, and only you that created this mess, and it is you and only you who has the power to see your way out of it…” 
			A middle aged Pakistani man with a pitiful mustache raised his hand. Before being addressed, and with his hand still raised awkwardly, he rose and spoke in a thick Indian accent.
			“But sir, I did not pay to hear philosophical musings. I was told you could teach me how to fuck on college girls and find a good wife.”
			“Fuck on college girls you may Kapul, find a wife you may… but if and only if you come to Understand the Truth… women, dating, fucking… these are a symptom, a mere by-product of Pimping. They are not the Mission. They are the ice cold cups of Gatorade waiting for you at the pit-stops on the marathon of life… on the real Mission at hand… If it is only sex with beautiful women you desire Kapul, then find the Master of Commerce, take a seminar, make yourself a small fortune, and go to a whore house… but I challenge you to ask yourself after the first load you spew, if that was ‘It,’ if that pop was the truest desire of your heart. For the True Desire of man never falters or retreats. It is always there, calling…”
			“But what could possibly be better than some good snatch Master?!” interjected the Indian man. The other men agreed. 
			“You are a mouse in a closet looking for cheese. A mouse with no awareness to the vastness of the house you live in. A mouse that could never even fathom a journey to the other side of the neighborhood. A mouse that could never understand the fact that the neighborhood is but a mouse to the city, the city a mouse to the nation, and the nation a mouse to Earth. Are you such a fool that you spent 4,000 dollars and flew from India to learn of the cheese in the closet? Lower your arm. Sit down.”
			“Sir… I was born in Georgia,” muttered the Pakistani man.
			“I enjoy cheese. Greatly, sir. My uncle owns a pizza parlor in Brooklyn. So you will teach us nothing of women? Please teach us of women, Master,” interjected a man who wanted to Believe.
			“I will teach you about women and the simple form of pimping as you know it to be, as conquering The Woman is the central battle in all of your narratives, and the greatest hurdle to your evolution. Her and her sweet titties and her sharp tongue, they are the center of your Universe. She sends fear up your spine, and electricity through your little dick. She makes your voice shake, and your knees weak. She takes one look at another man, and crushes your fragile soul. She must be conquered…”
			The men perked up, ready to receive and savor every word of esoteric wisdom the Master had in store.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“So he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself ‘the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,’ so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: ‘The first five rounds are on you.’ Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn’t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn’t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn’t for another two weeks—suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?”
			“I am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!” Gregory shouted without hesitation.
			“Yes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.’ This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of ‘losing’ some girl he doesn’t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.”
			“Sir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women… but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?” replied a curious believer.
			“No, no, no… you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I’m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from… a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call… I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot… there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself ‘How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?’ You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.”  
			“So I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?” replied the man.
			“No—on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection… for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp’s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man’s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“You can tell that to the judge,” the Head Fed snipped back. He turned to the group of men. 
			“Now as for you gentlemen… you too, have broken many serious new laws that come with stiff penalties and serious jail time. These laws include: One— Payment for Information Endangering Women… Two— Actively pursuing and engaging with a known Pimp… Three— Pursuing Pimpdom… Now I will present you with two options. You may plead negligence based on the newness of this law, verbally rebuke Pimpdom and your activities here today, and agree to reveal the financial details and all payments made to Mr. Sammy Davis Jr., to be used against in the court of law… or you can face the Law yourself, and continue your pursuits with Mr. Davis behind cold, metal bars for decades to come. I will now ask that the compliers of my first request come stand over here on the left side of the room with our agents.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">Raul stared blankly at the check for a moment. Part of him was in disbelief, as if he had dreamed whole charade.. He ran his finger softly down the spine of the check and accepted the Moment for what it was… a blessing, a new beginning… another shot at Life and the Dream.
			 Raul walked over to the closet and began shuffling through stacks of old magazines. He stopped and pulled out a worn catalog: Janitorial Worldwide. Flipping through it quickly, he stopped on a page with a faded bookmark. On the marked page was a picture of a high-tech janitorial van. Inside the van was an entire array of state-of-the-art cleaning tools and machinery. 
			Raul pulled out his phone and dialed. It rang once, and then clicked over to a voice message.
			“Hello, this is Raul Delgado. I’d like to place an order for two SCV7’s... And if at all possible, I would like to have flaming vacuums painted on the sides of both… and my logo of course… Please call me at 323-457-8794.” 
			After hanging up, he retrieved the check off the table, slid it into his wallet—then paused. Something else caught his eye inside. He pulled out a small card, read the number, and dialed. It rang four times before a familiar voice snapped:
			“Who the fuck ca—" barked the voice—But before the man could finish he was steamrolled by the cool and impassioned Pimp Raul.
			“Yes boss. This is Raul Delgado from Lake Crest… yes, Raul... I’m aware it’s 2 A.M... I figured it is the hour your wife gets the most horney sir… and seeing as it is a sheer impossibility she could ever get to your little dick under all that disgusting, hideous flubber, I was wondering if I dropped by and gave her some real pipe, the pipe she dreams about all day long, if you wouldn’t consider a promotion and handsome raise for me sir?”
			Raul’s eyes glowed like a sacred fire. He had tapped fully into a flow state of Fearless Presence as he spoke,
			“Fired, sir? Kill me, sir? How dare you… I offer a favor, and this is how you repay me?!” 
			Raul hung up the phone and let out a primal wail of the most joyous laughter. It rang through the halls of his apartment like a war cry and an exorcism. Like a true Pimp, he slowly reclined back into his couch with a big old shit-eating grin stretched across his face. 				He was a man reclaiming his legend—the same legend buried in every man, burning to be Remembered. Some will hear the Call. Others will be taken for the Ride. But in the end, there is only One Real Question every man must answer: Are you a Pimp… or a bitch?</p>
