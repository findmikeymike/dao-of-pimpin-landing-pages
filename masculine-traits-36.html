                <p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“So he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself ‘the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,’ so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: ‘The first five rounds are on you.’ Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn’t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn’t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn’t for another two weeks—suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?”
			“I am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!” Gregory shouted without hesitation.
			“Yes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.’ This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of ‘losing’ some girl he doesn’t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.”
			“Sir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women… but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?” replied a curious believer.
			“No, no, no… you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I’m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from… a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call… I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot… there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself ‘How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?’ You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.”  
			“So I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?” replied the man.
			“No—on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection… for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp’s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man’s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, if one seeks a good woman, what is he to look for?” Raul asked.
			“You will know a good woman when she appreciates and supports your Mission more than anyone, and to you, she gives more energy than she takes. Ask yourself: does she give energy and color to my life—or does she take it? If she’s a taker, cut her as quickly as possible! Life is simply too short to get tangled with one of these women. And whatever you do, do not let her beauty or sex appeal distort the Truth of Who She Is. This is where many a decent man has lost his soul and Way on the Path…” 
			“And in a longer term Dance with a woman, how is a man to go about himself. What does his relationship with the woman look like?” Raul followed up.
			“If a man and woman have chosen each other, passed each others preliminary “tests,” and embark on a longer journey together, it is absolutely crucial that a man Shows Himself from the beginning of this journey. He must be clear about the way he operates, what he values, what kind of relationship he is agreeing to. You are a man who values your solitude and spending time with your friends? Make this clear. You are a man who has a need for new sexual partners and wants to have threesomes? Make this clear. You are a man who showers with his socks on and wants not to be badgered about it? Make this clear… for if a man does not establish these pivotal concepts from the get go, he will have mountains of difficulty trying to establish Who and What he is down the line. He must also be crystal clear about his Mission and Will, and keep them front and center in his life. How many men ‘get’ a woman and grow content just having her? How many men become lazy and lose all passion for life and purpose? A man must carry on his Mission with the same fire he had before she even entered the picture. Staying on the Mission becomes the bedrock for his masculine center, and as a symptom, creates a healthy atmosphere and dynamic between him and his woman. The woman should always be aware of how important this Mission is to the man, and that no matter what happens between them, he will continue on his journey and the Mission at hand… he will survive and thrive… and as much as the man may love or value the woman, it is the Mission, the true Calling from somewhere ancient in him, that is the center of his Universe. If man heeds to this great notion, many problems with the woman and relationship are kept at bay. Understand a relationship is a balancing act, and as man tends to the Mission he must also find the energy to tend to his woman and the blossoming of her spirit as well. While you should never become the man who gives every shred of his time and attention, you also should never become the man who gives none of it. You must be There for your woman and support her journey. You must encourage and inspire the Magic within her. Be Present in the moment and Present with the woman. Do not just look at her, See her, Hear her. This is your duty to the woman, for she is on her own arduous journey and on her own type of Mission as well.”
			The Master ran both of his hands through what remained of his hair.
			“Make no mistake, there will be difficulties and friction along the way, as you are two individuals with different and sometimes conflicting Realities… and as goddamn difficult as it is in moments, man should do his best not to play into any confusion or chaos. In the moments he starts to feel himself grow angry or reactive and has the urge to throw the woman out the window, and finds himself on the verge of bursting, he should walk out of the room… exit the situation and take a moment to Realize the moment at hand. Realize in the grand scheme of everything and the vastness of the universe, there is no reason for the chaos. No point to engaging in theatrical, emotional nonsense with any other human.. be it his woman, his neighbor, or the world at large.” 
			“Master, how does one engage with other men in the world and deal with them on the Path?” asked the pudge with a lisp. 
			“There should be no issue unless said man is standing in the way of his Mission? How many men waste their time and energy dick-swinging, trying to impress other men, or trying to out ‘alpha’ the man standing next to them at the pub? You can smell the fear from a mile away. The highest form of the Masculine recognizes no rivals as he is on a journey of his own accord. He is only facing off with Himself. The outside world is none of his concern in this regard. He does not need other men to follow him, or to dominate every social situation, or receive accolades from other men and society, as his mind is busy with much greater pursuits and sees the emptiness of these endeavors.”
			The Master took a deep breath and scanned the room of men.
			“For there will come a day when all things on Earth wash away and fade into oblivion. The Pimp is aware of this. So when he sees his fellow man, he does not see an adversary or a threat, nor someone he needs to prove his status or stature above. He views other men through the lens of Brotherhood— until a time comes when that lens is no longer appropriate. He understands that in a higher sense, we are all reflections of each other in the dream of the Almighty, and that any separation with others around him is a construct of the Mind… a distraction from Truth. Man should aim to lift, energize, and inspire those around him, and hope for the same in return. This journey is no cake walk for anyone. He should spend his days with like-minded, spirited men—who are honest, grounded, and bold. And in the rare scenarios where it is Right—or necessary—for a man to go to battle, he shall put it in on his foes with no fucking mercy… and being willing to die for what he loves or believes in.” 
			The Master jumped to his feet, put an imaginary foe in a headlock, and drove two swift knee shots straight to the gut. He was more agile than he let on—his limp seemingly vanishing in an instant. As he prepared to body slam the phantom opponent, he paused …and turned his head upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">The metal chairs screeched in agony as the men pushed them aside and dove to the floor. 	Raul’s head hit the musky floor, inches from Gregory’s. He couldn’t help but notice the thousand microscopic beads of sweat sliding down Gregory’s mini mustache. 
			“Do you think… think this may be… a test, brother?” Gregory whispered as soft as a mouse. 
			“A test! Did you see the Fear in Master’s eyes? These are Federal Agents, Gregory! This is no theatre,” Raul hissed back. 
			Gregory squeezed his eyes shut and began to pant. The armed men had surrounded them now, their rifles aimed to kill. 
			There were six armed men on stage surrounding the Master. Two of the men grabbed the Master’s arms from behind with violent force, slamming cuffs on his wrists. The Master wailed in agony.  The leader of the Fed team knelt down in front of the Master and snarled,</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">The Head Fed set down his gun on the table and lit a cigarette ablaze. As he exhaled a waft of smoke, he began to slow clap, and in a cool calm tone, he spoke,
			“Gentlemen… it is with the Master’s blessings I hereby announce you Pimp’s of the First Degree. Congratulations and welcome to The Path.” 
			“Now get these fucking cuffs off us…  Jesus, Buck!.. how many times have I told you not to cuff me so fucking tight.. I’m not as nimble as I used to be... I’m an old ass man!” zipped the Master. 
			“At once, Master! Just making sure you haven’t gone full simp on us! My apologies sir!” the ‘Fed’ replied as he scurried behind the Master to finagle his cuffs.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">About two hours later, Gregory stepped outside of the bar with the tattooed woman on his back. She giggled as his little bones stammered to carry her weight. 
			“Good god! I had no idea cheap tattoos and daddy issues weighed so much!” Gregory jeered. 
			The woman laughed and slapped him on the head as they veered off into the night. 
			Raul came out a moment later, alone. Plastered on his face was the smirk of a man at ease with himself, a man who had just had a very good time out Dancing with life. The tattooed hotty’s friend popped out after him behind him and shouted: 
			“Raul! Are you not going to be a gentleman and invite me over for a night cap?”</p>
