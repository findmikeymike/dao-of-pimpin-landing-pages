                <p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">That afternoon, as Raul mopped the scum off the floor of the Lake Crest Motel’s bathroom, his mind spun in every direction. He pawed at his eyes, but the strange blue tint cast over his world would not wane. 
			A grossly overweight man with a tacky gold watch and sweat stains under his armpits entered the bathroom and approached one of the urinals. It was Raul’s boss, and though Raul was standing right in front of him, he did not acknowledge Raul... Furthermore, he had such little care for Raul’s presence that as he stood at the urinal, he passed gas, twice. Upon noticing the immaculately clean ground beneath his feet, he whipped his pecker to the side and shot a stream of urine right down the wall. As the urine began to form a small pool on the floor, he turned his head and acknowledged Raul…</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Master you speak oft of the Mission, the purpose of man, but truth be told I do not understand what this concept is really about. What is a man like me to do with himself, as surely a woman will sense I am mission-less?” said the pudgy lispy man.
			“First of all, know that your logic is not just backwards on a surface level, it is broken at its core. Man does not take on the Mission or pursue purpose to amuse or lure a woman. The woman literally has nothing to do with this. We will get back to the woman but know  this… man takes on the Mission for himself, and for his own evolution. So let us start by understanding first what Mission truly is and why it is imperative to every man’s journey. Listen to me closely... the Mission is the vessel for man’s evolution… on the mission, man throws himself into the the world of the unknown, to a space beyond his understandings, and outside the boundaries and limitations of mundane human “existence.” It is in the great rapids and storms of this world where the ordinary, Mechanical Mind is plundered and shattered as man moves from a state of passivity to Action.. He moves from a place of merely Existing, and reacting to the world around him—to Being, where he becomes the Action behind the world around him. He transforms from an observer of life to a Creator of life… from the Field to the Force... It is in this transformation that he Realizes many great Truths: that he is not ‘in’ the world, the world is in him. His life is not chaos or coincidence, it is of his making and his alone! For this is the great creative force the Almighty Pimp has bestowed upon man. Do you follow?’
			The congregation of men nodded in unison.
			“On the Mission, a man is tested over and over again as to whether he truly Understands these things, for if he does, he will never balk or surrender at the obstacles and set backs along the Way, as he is aware they are all of his own creation and immaculately placed opportunities he has created to prove himself to Himself! He becomes aware of his narrative and the archetypes around him. He sees the femme fatale clear as day, using her tight waist and big knockers to try to lore him back into the patterns of the lower, Mechanical Mind. He recognizes the Mentor, the unlikely figure offering wisdom and clues to his further evolution. He goes to war with his own Fear, the true Villain of his story… And with each progressive chapter of his journey, the Mechanical Mind begins to crumble and give way to the New Mind… For this is the evolution from man to Pimp.”
			“But Sir... I craft sandwiches at a local sub shop,” the pudge replied.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Okay? You craft sandwiches… and you say that as if it is an empty pursuit… a realm that holds no potential for any kind of evolution or magic... but let me tell you the potential Mission of man comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. It is not in the “what man does” but in the “how he does it.” Do not think that Mission means a man must start a multi-million dollar company, or win an Oscar, or reach some fantastical level of social status. You may have a man that’s truest calling in life is simply to Teach... maybe his passion is for history and he teaches a middle school class. What matters is the hunger, relentlessness, and creativity he approaches his teaching with. How far he is willing to push to be the most legendary teacher that ever walked the Earth? Let me ask you… why do you spend your life making sandwiches?” 
			“Because it pays a fair wage sir, and I get joy in seeing people eat. I love sauces and the way they can bring a sandwich to life. I put sauces on everything.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>
