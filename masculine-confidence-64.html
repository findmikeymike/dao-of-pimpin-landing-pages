                <p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“And now here you are, trying your best to pacify this sea of emotions, and win this woman’s affections back, and like the simp that you are, you waste the next six hours in a state of high anxiety, trying to find something clever to say to rekindle the fire with this woman. You’re sure you’ve got it… oh yeah. You’ve got it this time… and you hit the send… and the hands of the clock start ticking so slowly, they’re damn near going in reverse. Twenty minutes… two hours… the fear builds… eight hours… three days… and nothing. Not a word. You played out the sequence of an entire relationship with a girl you didn’t know from a hole in the ground, and the whole thing was a mirage, a head trip… You were on The Ride… from fear to love, from love to fear... And so usually you take a cold shower and chalk it up as another loss, bite down on the pain… another heartbreak in that bag you carry, a little more dead weight laid up on your spirit. But this time, this time is different, because not only were you watching it happen, you were feeling it happen, and you were beginning to Understand the Motion… the Language. And so like the crafty and stubborn and determined man that you are, the next one comes along and you flip the script. Beat for beat, you flip the fucking script. Right at the peak of the warmth and excitement, right when she sends you so many goddamn emojis you start to think the girl may have schizophrenia, right at the zenith of the Love and heat… you disappear… Nowhere to be found… And The Ride is in motion…”
			“But Master, surely the man with the classic smile and warm scent does have the advantage… You cannot tell me that wasn’t part of her attraction?” said an ambivalent man in the back.
			“I am teaching you real Magic, known and Understood by one man in ten thousand, and you’re still asking about the fellow with the classic smile and tangerine scent? Do you see what I mean when I say men miss the forest for the trees? Yes the man with the sharp smile does have an advantage. He, like you, has a false sense of the what the woman truly desires. He has been told his entire life that his beautiful face was the thing that truly spoke to the heart of a Woman, and therefore, rather conveniently, tricked himself into a conviction and confidence that allowed him to be at ease around women.”
			The Master turned and looked directly at the ambivalent man.
			 “I am not telling you that a woman does not have eyes, or can’t see a man with a perfectly symmetrical face, chiseled chest, strong arms and feel no Want. Yes, she absolutely may feel some tingle in her loins, have a visceral reaction, but I am telling you that her hither brains are taking those as signals… signals for something that she senses may lie under the surface… a man at ease with himself, a man with the power to Move her. I’m telling you that if that beefcake does not Move her emotions, and I get seven minutes alone with her in the back of some dimly lit dive bar, she will be rubbing my belly and calling me daddy in the bed of the nearest roach motel before one of you can say “But his abs!” 
			The Master shook his gut with both hands and continued.
			“Do you understand? What I am telling you is that a woman will adjust the way she Sees you to match the way that you make her feel…Listen carefully. I said a woman will adjust the way she sees you to match the way that you make here FEEL. Understand that sex appeal does not happen in the gym, it happens in the heart… in the attitude, in the energy. Take the ugliest motherfucker in this room, and if his Pimpin is tight enough, I’m telling you within twenty minutes she can be looking at him like he was the genetic spawn of Leonardo DiCaprio and Beyonce. Where’s my little Indian friend? Yes, even you Kapul.”
			“My name is not Kapul, it is Gregory, Master,” said the Indian man meekly.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“She is not the enemy. She is just like me!” Shouted the men devoted men. 
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” yelled The Master.
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” chanted the choir. 
			“She shits and she does not always wash!”
			“She shits and she does not always wash!” they roared! 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“Very good,” said the Master. 
			“Hold tight to the mantra, men! The mantra is all we need!” shouted the chubby man with the lisp.
 			The Master threw his hand up in the air to halt the blossoming of a false notion.
			“No! For this is just the beginning! This is only one mantra, one practice, one compartment of the Mind. We will not stop here… We must eliminate not just the Web of the Woman, but every web you have ever spun!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Master, I once heard a man I presumed wise say that ‘she is never your girl, it’s just your turn.’ That a female is always looking for the better deal? Is this so? Is there hope for a man who does not need a harem and would like to find a woman to spend his life with?” 
			“Due to the impermanence of most relationships—not just those with the woman, you could say there’s some Truth to that... but the idea that all women are just slaves to their genetic imperatives—constantly on the hunt for a higher-status man ignores that there is more to a woman… and more to humanity, than just evolution and chemistry. The Deep Web Overlords who preach this fail to see the bigger picture: that the soul of a being has been on a long journey, each at different levels of refinement and Awareness. Ask the same man who said, ‘all woman are the same and will surely betray you’ about Mother Theresa and he will tell you she did not go around the world to feed the needy, she went around the world to try a cock from every nation! The truth of the matter is that the majority of humans in the present era, women and men alike, do not stick to any strict moral or ethical code and have been conditioned to look out for Themselves and do whatever feels good. So yes, you will meet many base women, many scoundrels, many undercover hookers, just as the decent women out there will meet many pathetic, limp men. Both sexes are a victim to the lies of the Shadow, and there distrust of each other so deep, entire movements and groups have formed... the Feminists, the Red Pillers... each using the other as a scapegoat for their own confusion. With such chaos in the modern age, is it possible to find a good woman to spend your life with? To that I say, I do believe it is possible for two souls on a similar frequency, with a certain sense of maturity and clarity, to live consciously and enjoy a life together. If it is your Will and Desire to meet a good-hearted, honest woman to spend the rest of your days with, then let it be so… romance it up, Dance with no fear. But know this—even if a man has the desire to spend his life with someone, he should be equipped to carry on the Mission and the Journey if the deeper power within him or the Almighty Pimp has other plans. For life is fleeting, love is fleeting, the world is fleeting, always, into the Great Abyss…”
			“Master, that was somehow… painfully hopeful and beautifully excruciating,” Gregory chirped.
			“Isn’t that the nature of life, Gregory? What Magic would there be—what Ride—if not for the Love and the Fear, the pain and the beauty, the symmetry and the chaos… That’s why we emphasize fluidity… and being like the River… Man must Understand everything just Is… You come with nothing, you leave with nothing. That.. is True Freedom.”</p>
