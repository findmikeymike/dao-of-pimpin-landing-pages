                <p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Master speak to us of the Process… in real life, how one begins this transformation,” said one of devout men. 
			“Before you splash one drop of shitty cologne on your neck or step one toe towards the Path of the Pimp... you must know the reality. You must know that in this moment, you and every man around you is only flirting with an idea, finger-blasting a beautiful fantasy. Like all the greatest things on the journey of life, it will take every drop of blood in your veins, every bead of sweat your skin can muster, for the unlikely chance at Pimpdom. The Path of the Pimp will take much work—it will take pain, a hell-storm of discomfort and embarrassment... Look at the man beside you, now look around the room…”
			The Master paused for a moment as the men surveyed those around them. He continued,
			“Now think back to the assembly of hemorrhoidal lumps who scampered out of here and rushed home to their infernos of emptiness before the show even began... and hear the Truth: In this moment, you think I am talking to you, that I am here for you, and that this room is some sort of mystical fraternity of rejects that are off to slay the dragon together. You imagine us meeting up a few years down the line, drinking cocktails and eating chicken fingers, busting each other's chops, and sharing nude screenshots of beautiful women in compromising positions… Yet again, you have fallen for the Fairy Tale and deceived yourself. The truth is, I am here today, right now, in this very fucking moment speaking to One man. It is he, and only he that I am speaking to. It is he, and only he, that has the chance to walk the Path of the Pimp. The rest of you are nothing more than extras cast for an hourly rate to fill his story with color and motion. So I ask you now, in your heart of hearts: are you He? If not, I am promising you this endeavor is not only a waste of your time, but will cause more pain and discomfort.”
			Twelve men got up and left the room. The remaining men got up and filled their seats closer to the Master. Raul, Gregory, and the chubby man with the lisp sat front and center. Judas, the lone wolf, refused to yield to the Master and stayed put in his seat, just close enough to lob his grenades, but far enough to feel untouchable.
			The air of camaraderie was gone. The feeling of Simp fellowship and Beta brotherhood, liquidated. For every man now Understood that if by the grace of the Almighty Pimp it was his mission, he would be going alone... 
			“Master I don’t presume you will tell us which man here is He, but may I ask if you think there is any hope for me in particular? Could you imagine me ever becoming even the lowliest of Pimps with a generous effort? I work many hours of the week, sir, but I am determined to have my pie.” 
			The Master laughed hysterically. He laughed so hard he fell backwards out of his upright posture and was laid flat on the ground. It took him a full minute to compose himself. The room was silent again, and while still laid out flat on his back, the Master spoke in a soft and sympathetic tone. 
			“Kapul, if my opinion is what you seek... I could not imagine you fucking a dead bird in a bush, let alone a woman. You’re a computer technician… a computer tech-nish-an... and nothing more. You were born to chip away at motherboards and untangle snake pits of electronic cords. You are weak, your mustache, repulsive… Your little hands equipped to your body for no other reason than to place bottles of discount lotion up by the register, your eyes, only placed in your skull to scan obscure pornography until the hour when night meets day. There is no hope for you. No hope at all. It gives me no pleasure to say this, Kapul… You are dismissed.”
 			And with his words, a different type of silence fell on the room of men. A silence so sad and empty it was as if the world itself stopped spinning to pay its respect to the complete annihilation of a human soul. Gregory sat there like a stone, the blood from his face and what remained of his erection drained down into his little feet. The hairs of his mustache curled inwards, as if the last drops of life and sweat had been snuffed out of them. They had given it everything they had, trying to convince the world that together they were a real mustache, but the time had come when they could no longer even fool themselves. 	For Gregory and the Mini Mustache, the voyage to the ‘Land of a Thousand Yearning Pussys and Maybe a Good Wife,’ was over. 
			“Go on now little Indian man! Surely there are some other gay little Indians you can seduce at the local curry hole! The rest of us want to hear what other nonsense this ‘Master’ has in store!” Judas snipped. 
			Gregory began to rise to his feet but a swift and strong arm jerked him back down.				“Who are these men to tell you your fate? If the Master’s words are Truth, then it is you— and you alone— who decides what Awaits you. Do not fail yourself, Kapul,” Raul whispered with an unusual conviction. 
			There was a gleam in Gregory’s left eye, and then a gleam in the right. He leaned into Raul, paused for a beat, and whispered back:
			“For you my brother in pussy, anti-virus scan… any time… free of charge.”
 			Gregory shot a wink at Raul, turned to the Master, who was still laid out on the floor, and shouted.
			“But Master you made no mention of my tongue! And I am only left to assume it is because you fear the tsunami it could unleash in between the thighs of the woman you love most… ‘Yes Kapul, yes,’ she says.. ‘I can’t wait a minute longer Kapul.. Pound these thick cheeks with that Anaconda, Kapul.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“She is not the enemy. She is just like me!” Shouted the men devoted men. 
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” yelled The Master.
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” chanted the choir. 
			“She shits and she does not always wash!”
			“She shits and she does not always wash!” they roared! 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“Very good,” said the Master. 
			“Hold tight to the mantra, men! The mantra is all we need!” shouted the chubby man with the lisp.
 			The Master threw his hand up in the air to halt the blossoming of a false notion.
			“No! For this is just the beginning! This is only one mantra, one practice, one compartment of the Mind. We will not stop here… We must eliminate not just the Web of the Woman, but every web you have ever spun!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Now let us face the beast: Fear… There is natural fear, the healthy fear that was programmed into the hardware of your mind at birth to keep you alive... this  fear is not the problem. The problem lies in the conditioned fear and aversions, the ones you have gathered along the journey that are irrational, and serve you in no way. The majority of these fears are of a social nature, and have to do with your acceptance in the tribe. There was a time when these fears served a purpose for man, as being cast out of the tribe meant certain death in the wild, but both man and the world alike have evolved. A man can survive and thrive on his own without the approval of the family, friends, and society around him. In many ways, his willingness to leave ‘The Group' is the beginning of his journey to his highest self, the true Pimp in him. Look at the life of any Christ or Buddha or great rockstar and you will see… they did not walk in line with society, they vowed for no man or woman’s approval… the Magic of their lives and stories was in opposition to these things.”
 			“Master, tell us more of dealing with these fears and entanglements,” exclaimed Gregory. 
			“First, we understand the difference between fear and aversion. Both must be conquered on the path to Pimpdom. The fear is what makes your heart race and hands shake. Aversions are the things that make you less comfortable in life and bring an unpleasantness to your mind. To unwrite these softwares of fear and aversion you have installed in the Mind, we first be conscious of them. For each of you has had different experiences and spun different webs… different Imprints… and accordingly, there will be different paths to their undoing. Let’s start with you, snacker with the lisp, tell me something that makes your skin crawl, something that strikes no fear in you, but you avoid like the plague.”
			“I hate being wet in clothing, sir. Especially jeans… I do not leave the house when it’s raining past a drizzle.” 
			“Well good gracious, imagine that… a grown man refusing to be involved with life and the world because he does not want to get a little wet. How much Magic and opportunity he may have missed lingering just beyond the rain… It was the Log Flume I presume?” 
			“Good god, Master? How—how could you have known? Yes, it was indeed the Log Flume. I remember being ten years old at the waterpark and the woman guaranteeing me if I sat in the back I would not take on any water… at worst a light mist. I was soaked to the bone and my breasts and rolls protruded from my t-shirt and the other children called me the Flume Whale for nearly a year!” 
			“And as the pain and embarrassment of such an archetypal scene was branded with a hot iron into the Mind, the Web began to spin… the fear left a trail… a present day aversion… and a very silly thing that holds you back in life. It will only continue to hinder you so we must destroy it at once! I want you to put on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt every single day for the next month and have your neighbor dowse you with a hose before you leave your house. I mean drenched and dripping to the damn bone. When you are soaked to the bone, I want you to verbally say aloud, ‘Out with all remnants and noise of the past, for they are but a dream. I am baptized in these waters and made clean again.’ Then go about your business as usual... The first few days you will think of nothing but your discomfort, but with each passing day, you will become used to it. Your mind will accept that you are wet and surrender its useless fight... and day by day the imprint in your mind will begin to evaporate, hell you may even begin to enjoy the cool sensation it brings and how alert you have become. You may start enjoying it so goddamn much you have to pay your neighbor a monthly salary to hose you down in your clothes everyday...” 
			“Master I have no relation with my neighbors.” 
			“Then it will be one hell of an ice breaker... ‘Hello my good man, would you mind spraying me with your fucking hose?’ What sane man could refuse such good fun?”
			“But Master if—”
			The pudgy man tried to interject but was steamrolled by the impassioned Master.
			“After you have completed this torrential month, I want you to repeat the process, but this time, I want you out in the world shirtless. Let those titties swing and that belly shake. For we must get to the root of this web, right down to the fear that birthed it.”
			The pudgy man with the lisp opened his mouth to respond but the Master pressed on.
			“Now let us move on to someone else. You there... little ginger man with the large nose, hiding his head… yes, you… what is that haunts your dreams?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory entered the Tavern with an energy and ease they had never stepped into anywhere before…. like two young warriors who had just put their lives on the line for the first time and claimed victory in a fierce battle. Only an hour ago they’d been staring down a life behind bars... what was there to fear? Who or what could possibly Move them after a day like today? 
			As they approached the bar, a young hottie with tattoos grabbed Gregory’s arm. 
			“Hey daddy… how about a beer for the pretty lady? Hm? Buy me a beer?” yapped the hottie with an air of entitlement and expectation. 
			“Would you like my ATM number too?” Gregory replied in a calm, careless tone. 
			The girl was a bit taken aback. It was not what she expected to hear come out of this small Indian man’s mouth. 
			“Well, if you give me your ATM number, I could take you to get a haircut and maybe even get that dirty little mustache shaved off,” she challenged.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">When Raul got home, he sank into the couch and pulled the brown envelope from his pocket. He unfolded the envelope and placed it on the table in front of him. 
			As he replayed the Magic and adventure of the day, he became curious about so many things. How did the Master know my name? I never even spoke it… and I used a fake name when I signed up? Where was Master from? How many able Pimps were out there?…  He even wondered what the fake legal documents detailing his ‘crimes of Pimping’ might look like, and how clever the Master’s final Test was. He thought about framing the document and posting it in his bedroom as a constant reminder of The Path. 
			Raul tore the envelope and reached inside. He pulled out a folded sheet of paper and read aloud to himself:</p>
