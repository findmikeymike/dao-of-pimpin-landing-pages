                <p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“We are gathered here today to solve a riddle as old as time. You can thank Adam— for when he first slid his crooked finger into the soft, warm slit of Eve, he set in motion the Eternal Conundrum of Man and a millennia of madness.. You have ensnared yourself in the Trap of all traps, and yet you have no idea of your own captivity. You came today with childish questions of pussy-piping and pick up lines, and it’s my lone hope that when you leave today, you will leave with something else entirely… And it will not be answer you came looking for. In fact, it will be a question.. The One Real Question… Neither I, nor Saint Peter himself has the answer for you. For it was you, and only you that created this mess, and it is you and only you who has the power to see your way out of it…” 
			A middle aged Pakistani man with a pitiful mustache raised his hand. Before being addressed, and with his hand still raised awkwardly, he rose and spoke in a thick Indian accent.
			“But sir, I did not pay to hear philosophical musings. I was told you could teach me how to fuck on college girls and find a good wife.”
			“Fuck on college girls you may Kapul, find a wife you may… but if and only if you come to Understand the Truth… women, dating, fucking… these are a symptom, a mere by-product of Pimping. They are not the Mission. They are the ice cold cups of Gatorade waiting for you at the pit-stops on the marathon of life… on the real Mission at hand… If it is only sex with beautiful women you desire Kapul, then find the Master of Commerce, take a seminar, make yourself a small fortune, and go to a whore house… but I challenge you to ask yourself after the first load you spew, if that was ‘It,’ if that pop was the truest desire of your heart. For the True Desire of man never falters or retreats. It is always there, calling…”
			“But what could possibly be better than some good snatch Master?!” interjected the Indian man. The other men agreed. 
			“You are a mouse in a closet looking for cheese. A mouse with no awareness to the vastness of the house you live in. A mouse that could never even fathom a journey to the other side of the neighborhood. A mouse that could never understand the fact that the neighborhood is but a mouse to the city, the city a mouse to the nation, and the nation a mouse to Earth. Are you such a fool that you spent 4,000 dollars and flew from India to learn of the cheese in the closet? Lower your arm. Sit down.”
			“Sir… I was born in Georgia,” muttered the Pakistani man.
			“I enjoy cheese. Greatly, sir. My uncle owns a pizza parlor in Brooklyn. So you will teach us nothing of women? Please teach us of women, Master,” interjected a man who wanted to Believe.
			“I will teach you about women and the simple form of pimping as you know it to be, as conquering The Woman is the central battle in all of your narratives, and the greatest hurdle to your evolution. Her and her sweet titties and her sharp tongue, they are the center of your Universe. She sends fear up your spine, and electricity through your little dick. She makes your voice shake, and your knees weak. She takes one look at another man, and crushes your fragile soul. She must be conquered…”
			The men perked up, ready to receive and savor every word of esoteric wisdom the Master had in store.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Exactly twenty two minutes later the Master reemerged onto the stage. This time doing a little sashay to the center. He sat back down in lotus position, rubbed his hands together and spoke with a mischievous grin. 
			“The Master takes his medicine, and relieves himself and twenty men disappear? Tsk Tsk.. It is not their time. And it may not be yours either, but know that just by still being seated, Here... in this moment... there is something Alive and Aware in you. For you are learning to see through the simple deceptions and tests of the world, and you are operating with stillness and patience. It is these characteristics that make the Pimp so smooth, so crafty, so capable...” 
			“Master speak more to of us of stillness and patience,” said Raul.
			“Stillness, patience.. these are qualities of a man moving beyond the Mechanical Mind who realizes in the physical sense, there is nowhere Here to go.. no reason to race past the cars on the street only to sit next to them at the red light a mile ahead. Now let’s speak on these qualities in regard to your relations with the woman. The average man receives a message from a woman he is conversing with, and what does he do? First, he thinks to himself ‘I have seen enough YouTube videos to know I must wait a bit before I respond, as I would not want to come across as needy.’ Six minutes in and the Fear starts to knock at his chest, ‘but if I wait any longer, maybe another man may snatch her attention.’ Approximately eight minutes after receiving her message, he responds with some half-witted tease that has no Magic or direction, for he has no idea where he is even taking this woman. The slightly stronger man, he responds in seventeen minutes. His message has a semblance of direction and Magic, and is just enough to warrant another casual response as she continues to test the water with the most base level of curiosity and bask in the validation of his attention. But what about the Pimp? Where is the Pimp in all of this and what the hell is he up to?”
			“He’s going to pound town on the triplets he met at the Walgreens! Ain’t he Master?” hooted the pudgy man. 
			The master dismissed the man’s juvenile remark with a wave of his hand.
			“The pimp is busy slaying the real dragon. He doesn’t even see her message until the next day. When he does, he reads it—along with seven other messages from similar women—and begins to scan for the woman that has a high level of interest, and knows how to Dance.. the one who is alive and present, and returns Magic with Magic. But then… there is a ring at the doorbell, so he drops the phone and the women and runs to the door. On his step is a mysterious package.. the one he has been anticipating! So he takes the package and scurries down into his basement... In the corner of the basement is a make-shift laboratory with shelves full of strange chemicals and glass beakers. The man rips open the package, throws on his goggles and shouts, ‘Pfizer said it couldn’t be done! Moderna said it was light years away! But nay! One man discovered the elixir in his basement! The first and only true cure for Swamp Ass is on its way!’ He stays entranced in his chemistry for the next four days straight, and emerges with a smile on his face, for he has made another inch of progress on the thousand mile journey. ‘My my what a victory.. I could really go for a cold gatorade and a recharge!’ he says to himself.”
			The Master arched his head back and simulated big gulps from a bottle. He wiped his head and continued.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Okay? You craft sandwiches… and you say that as if it is an empty pursuit… a realm that holds no potential for any kind of evolution or magic... but let me tell you the potential Mission of man comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. It is not in the “what man does” but in the “how he does it.” Do not think that Mission means a man must start a multi-million dollar company, or win an Oscar, or reach some fantastical level of social status. You may have a man that’s truest calling in life is simply to Teach... maybe his passion is for history and he teaches a middle school class. What matters is the hunger, relentlessness, and creativity he approaches his teaching with. How far he is willing to push to be the most legendary teacher that ever walked the Earth? Let me ask you… why do you spend your life making sandwiches?” 
			“Because it pays a fair wage sir, and I get joy in seeing people eat. I love sauces and the way they can bring a sandwich to life. I put sauces on everything.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Sir I cannot understand for the life of me this aspect of women. They say all kinds of shit and the next minute it's something else. My last girlfriend told me I was the love of her life and just two weeks later I found her sending dirty pictures and cucumber emojicons to a male friend she told me was a homosexual! It has destroyed me!”</p>
