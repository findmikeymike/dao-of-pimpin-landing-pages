                <p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Sammy Davis Jr., you are under arrest by the Federal Police of Justice for high crimes of the many. You have the right to remain silent as I hereby announce these crimes. Under the newly passed Federal Women’s Protection Act, in effect April 16th, pursuant code 769BBC, “Pimping" in all of its forms comes with a life sentence… The crimes you have committed under the umbrella of this law include: One… Unlawful disclosure of the Woman’s Psychology. Two… Manipulation of Historical Sexual Dynamics. Three… Radicalizing and Sexually Weaponizing Males. Four… Collecting money in Women Endangering Pursuits… last but not least, Five— using the word “Faggot” and “bitch” among other terms deemed unlawful. We have all of this on tape.” 
			The Master dropped his head and began to sob. 
			“But… but... I’m Black?" he whimpered.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">Neither Raul nor Gregory moved an inch. Their faces and eyes like steel as they stared off with the Fed. 
			“GO YOU DUMBASS COCKSUCKERS!” The Master implored. 
			“I’m afraid I cannot do that, sir.. as I am, at the moment, embarked on a great Mission I will not sway from,” said Gregory. 
			“I too, am on a great Mission and ready for whatever lies ahead,” said Raul. 
			The head Fed looked to the Master. The Master let out a long, deep sigh. 
			“You heard the men… we’re finished here,” said the Master in defeat.</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory entered the Tavern with an energy and ease they had never stepped into anywhere before…. like two young warriors who had just put their lives on the line for the first time and claimed victory in a fierce battle. Only an hour ago they’d been staring down a life behind bars... what was there to fear? Who or what could possibly Move them after a day like today? 
			As they approached the bar, a young hottie with tattoos grabbed Gregory’s arm. 
			“Hey daddy… how about a beer for the pretty lady? Hm? Buy me a beer?” yapped the hottie with an air of entitlement and expectation. 
			“Would you like my ATM number too?” Gregory replied in a calm, careless tone. 
			The girl was a bit taken aback. It was not what she expected to hear come out of this small Indian man’s mouth. 
			“Well, if you give me your ATM number, I could take you to get a haircut and maybe even get that dirty little mustache shaved off,” she challenged.</p>
