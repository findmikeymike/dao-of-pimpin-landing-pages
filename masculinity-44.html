                <p class="student">Master, Many teachings about masculinity seem superficial. What is the deeper truth?</p>

<p class="master">Raul the Pimp, 		Let the contents of this envelope serve you on 
	The Path. It is of no use to me and may be of use to you. If you find it useful, use it to your advantage, and let it support you in the true Mission of your heart.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've heard many perspectives on this topic. What is the truth according to the Dao?</p>

<p class="master">Raul stared blankly at the check for a moment. Part of him was in disbelief, as if he had dreamed whole charade.. He ran his finger softly down the spine of the check and accepted the Moment for what it was… a blessing, a new beginning… another shot at Life and the Dream.
			 Raul walked over to the closet and began shuffling through stacks of old magazines. He stopped and pulled out a worn catalog: Janitorial Worldwide. Flipping through it quickly, he stopped on a page with a faded bookmark. On the marked page was a picture of a high-tech janitorial van. Inside the van was an entire array of state-of-the-art cleaning tools and machinery. 
			Raul pulled out his phone and dialed. It rang once, and then clicked over to a voice message.
			“Hello, this is Raul Delgado. I’d like to place an order for two SCV7’s... And if at all possible, I would like to have flaming vacuums painted on the sides of both… and my logo of course… Please call me at 323-457-8794.” 
			After hanging up, he retrieved the check off the table, slid it into his wallet—then paused. Something else caught his eye inside. He pulled out a small card, read the number, and dialed. It rang four times before a familiar voice snapped:
			“Who the fuck ca—" barked the voice—But before the man could finish he was steamrolled by the cool and impassioned Pimp Raul.
			“Yes boss. This is Raul Delgado from Lake Crest… yes, Raul... I’m aware it’s 2 A.M... I figured it is the hour your wife gets the most horney sir… and seeing as it is a sheer impossibility she could ever get to your little dick under all that disgusting, hideous flubber, I was wondering if I dropped by and gave her some real pipe, the pipe she dreams about all day long, if you wouldn’t consider a promotion and handsome raise for me sir?”
			Raul’s eyes glowed like a sacred fire. He had tapped fully into a flow state of Fearless Presence as he spoke,
			“Fired, sir? Kill me, sir? How dare you… I offer a favor, and this is how you repay me?!” 
			Raul hung up the phone and let out a primal wail of the most joyous laughter. It rang through the halls of his apartment like a war cry and an exorcism. Like a true Pimp, he slowly reclined back into his couch with a big old shit-eating grin stretched across his face. 				He was a man reclaiming his legend—the same legend buried in every man, burning to be Remembered. Some will hear the Call. Others will be taken for the Ride. But in the end, there is only One Real Question every man must answer: Are you a Pimp… or a bitch?</p>
