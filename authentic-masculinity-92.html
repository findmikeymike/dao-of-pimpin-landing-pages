                <p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“You missed a spot,” he snarled. 
			Raul’s blood began to boil. He had a fleeting vision of cracking the man over the head with the handle of his mop and flushing his remains down the toilet. It was not the first time he had been treated with such disrespect and contempt by his boss, but it was the most brash, and as infuriated as he was in the moment, there was a part of him that felt it was deserved. You are thirty-eight years old Raul! And this is how you spend your precious life? Cleaning toilets and replacing light bulbs for barbarians! Slaving away for pennies! It’s been twenty years now, Raul! Get it together!
			There was a more hopeful time in Raul’s life when he did have a Dream. He had grand and lucid visions of his very own janitorial company, ‘Delgado’s Diligent Cleaning.’ The most esteemed and prestigious cleaning service in all of Little Rock. Raul could see in vivid, crystallized color a satellite view of his vans crawling on every corner of the city. He saw people at stop lights giving the thumbs up to his workers and the occasional woman flashing her bosoms in the front yard as he passed in the ‘Boss Van’. He saw warm, pink suds soaking into terminally ill carpet, and a time-lapse of their resuscitations to a youthful vigor. 
			But as the gears of the galaxy churned on, and the years passed, and the hell-raising women crept in the cracks of his sad life to tap the last of his blood, the color and clarity of Raul’s visions faded away, leaving behind only the carcass of a Dream.. a pile of bones and a few shreds of dried meat. He needed a win in life, something… anything... to give him a bit of faith and keep him Going. 
			Raul pulled out of the Lake Crest parking lot and  floored it. His ’87 Volvo shrieked and wailed as it barreled down the open road, rattling maniacally as it surged to its top speed. The odometer read thirty-eight miles per hour. With the motel and all of its horror finally out of sight, Raul dug into his pocket, pulled out the mystical notecard, and placed it in his lap. He gently stroked the card with his thumb, over and over, as if to ensure its secrets would not escape. The cars behind him on the single lane road beeped in agony, just as they always did. “Forget them, Raul! Stay focused… You may just be holding the ticket to a new life, Raul!” he thought to himself. In four short days, he would have his answer.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“We are gathered here today to solve a riddle as old as time. You can thank Adam— for when he first slid his crooked finger into the soft, warm slit of Eve, he set in motion the Eternal Conundrum of Man and a millennia of madness.. You have ensnared yourself in the Trap of all traps, and yet you have no idea of your own captivity. You came today with childish questions of pussy-piping and pick up lines, and it’s my lone hope that when you leave today, you will leave with something else entirely… And it will not be answer you came looking for. In fact, it will be a question.. The One Real Question… Neither I, nor Saint Peter himself has the answer for you. For it was you, and only you that created this mess, and it is you and only you who has the power to see your way out of it…” 
			A middle aged Pakistani man with a pitiful mustache raised his hand. Before being addressed, and with his hand still raised awkwardly, he rose and spoke in a thick Indian accent.
			“But sir, I did not pay to hear philosophical musings. I was told you could teach me how to fuck on college girls and find a good wife.”
			“Fuck on college girls you may Kapul, find a wife you may… but if and only if you come to Understand the Truth… women, dating, fucking… these are a symptom, a mere by-product of Pimping. They are not the Mission. They are the ice cold cups of Gatorade waiting for you at the pit-stops on the marathon of life… on the real Mission at hand… If it is only sex with beautiful women you desire Kapul, then find the Master of Commerce, take a seminar, make yourself a small fortune, and go to a whore house… but I challenge you to ask yourself after the first load you spew, if that was ‘It,’ if that pop was the truest desire of your heart. For the True Desire of man never falters or retreats. It is always there, calling…”
			“But what could possibly be better than some good snatch Master?!” interjected the Indian man. The other men agreed. 
			“You are a mouse in a closet looking for cheese. A mouse with no awareness to the vastness of the house you live in. A mouse that could never even fathom a journey to the other side of the neighborhood. A mouse that could never understand the fact that the neighborhood is but a mouse to the city, the city a mouse to the nation, and the nation a mouse to Earth. Are you such a fool that you spent 4,000 dollars and flew from India to learn of the cheese in the closet? Lower your arm. Sit down.”
			“Sir… I was born in Georgia,” muttered the Pakistani man.
			“I enjoy cheese. Greatly, sir. My uncle owns a pizza parlor in Brooklyn. So you will teach us nothing of women? Please teach us of women, Master,” interjected a man who wanted to Believe.
			“I will teach you about women and the simple form of pimping as you know it to be, as conquering The Woman is the central battle in all of your narratives, and the greatest hurdle to your evolution. Her and her sweet titties and her sharp tongue, they are the center of your Universe. She sends fear up your spine, and electricity through your little dick. She makes your voice shake, and your knees weak. She takes one look at another man, and crushes your fragile soul. She must be conquered…”
			The men perked up, ready to receive and savor every word of esoteric wisdom the Master had in store.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Master... I… I don’t kn—“
			“Shush! You will or you won’t, Gregory. Know that in the grandest sense of it all, this is the One Real Question, the one real choice for man: Action or death. There is no halfway, no low-level pimp... One either takes Action and dives head first into the abyss or he submits to being another cog in the machine, another Mechanical Mind humming along through the scenes of life, pretending to be alive… At the heart of this all, at the core of everything said here today, understand that it is the Pimp who chooses Life, he who answers the Call with Action. You thought the Pimp was he who fucks women… I am telling you— it is the Pimp who fucks the shit out of life.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“We love you master! We shall meet you in Pussy Heaven!” 
			The Master’s disciples scurried eagerly out of the auditorium. There was a new world awaiting them. A world of pussy, and Magic, and foul smelling toilets… As Raul walked towards the exit, he savored the Master’s last words, and as he savored each of them, he was struck dead in his track. “A dame has called on me. I must go. A dame has called on me. I must go.” Master? Leave his Mission for the beckoning call of a woman? Leave men in the birthplace of true Understanding for a quick and trivial nut? Oh Raul! You were almost fooled! A test so obvious! Look at the energy and impatience of these men that walk beside you! They are in fantasy land! 
			Raul turned and started back towards the stage. There were a handful of perceptive men who had not left their chairs. Raul reclaimed his seat next to Gregory, one of the few Unmovable devotees. Gregory leaned in to him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“Master you speak oft of the Mission, the purpose of man, but truth be told I do not understand what this concept is really about. What is a man like me to do with himself, as surely a woman will sense I am mission-less?” said the pudgy lispy man.
			“First of all, know that your logic is not just backwards on a surface level, it is broken at its core. Man does not take on the Mission or pursue purpose to amuse or lure a woman. The woman literally has nothing to do with this. We will get back to the woman but know  this… man takes on the Mission for himself, and for his own evolution. So let us start by understanding first what Mission truly is and why it is imperative to every man’s journey. Listen to me closely... the Mission is the vessel for man’s evolution… on the mission, man throws himself into the the world of the unknown, to a space beyond his understandings, and outside the boundaries and limitations of mundane human “existence.” It is in the great rapids and storms of this world where the ordinary, Mechanical Mind is plundered and shattered as man moves from a state of passivity to Action.. He moves from a place of merely Existing, and reacting to the world around him—to Being, where he becomes the Action behind the world around him. He transforms from an observer of life to a Creator of life… from the Field to the Force... It is in this transformation that he Realizes many great Truths: that he is not ‘in’ the world, the world is in him. His life is not chaos or coincidence, it is of his making and his alone! For this is the great creative force the Almighty Pimp has bestowed upon man. Do you follow?’
			The congregation of men nodded in unison.
			“On the Mission, a man is tested over and over again as to whether he truly Understands these things, for if he does, he will never balk or surrender at the obstacles and set backs along the Way, as he is aware they are all of his own creation and immaculately placed opportunities he has created to prove himself to Himself! He becomes aware of his narrative and the archetypes around him. He sees the femme fatale clear as day, using her tight waist and big knockers to try to lore him back into the patterns of the lower, Mechanical Mind. He recognizes the Mentor, the unlikely figure offering wisdom and clues to his further evolution. He goes to war with his own Fear, the true Villain of his story… And with each progressive chapter of his journey, the Mechanical Mind begins to crumble and give way to the New Mind… For this is the evolution from man to Pimp.”
			“But Sir... I craft sandwiches at a local sub shop,” the pudge replied.</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">Raul and Gregory looked over at each other and burst into a hysterical, bewildered laughter. They were both feeling so many things in this moment... The Master had taken them on quite the Ride.
			“Twenty eight years we been running this same jig and every time it’s some bullshit! How many fucking choppers was that?! I said get two! Two! Not ten!” 
			The Master rattled off his cuffs and outstretched his arms as Buck moved to uncuff Raul and Gregory.
			“Hey, how about that ‘but but.. I’m black” bit?! Pretty damn good huh?!” chuckled the Master. 
			“It was very funny… a very nice touch Master. I swear your wit only gets sharper with age.” 
			The Master smiled a joyous smile. He turned to Raul and Gregory. 
			“Gentlemen, today has been quite the adventure… but this is just the beginning… you have taken the first step on a great journey… What you do from here is your own Choosing, it is of your own Will.. l am no longer of any use to you… as your hearts, and minds, and Mission will guide the way. I welcome you to the Path of the Pimp… Grab your envelopes off this table and go give life a good, hard fucking.” 
			The Master looked in Raul’s eyes and bowed his head. Then he looked in Gregory’s eyes and bowed his head. And with that, he grabbed his envelope off the table and began to sing “Fire and Rain” joyfully again as he sashayed out the door.				
			Raul and Gregory grabbed the brown manila envelopes tagged with their names, folded them down the center, shoved them in their pockets and headed out the door a moment behind The Master.  
			As they made their way out the front door of the building, Raul scanned the streets, expecting to get one last glimpse of the Master walking off into the distance, but the Master was nowhere in sight. As if by real Magic, the man had disappeared back into the mystical ether from which he first emerged.  
			As Raul pondered the mystery of the Master and surveyed the unknown world around him, he heard Gregory’s voice.
			“My brother… I guess there was room for two to walk the Path after all.”
