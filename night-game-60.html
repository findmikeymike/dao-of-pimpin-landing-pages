                <p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">Somewhere in southern Florida at 4 A.M., Raul sat in a gigantic, windowless auditorium with 1,253 other broken and helpless men. The auditorium was cold and archaic, giving the impression it hadn’t seen a lick of activity in the last twenty years. The air in the room smelled like vinegar and mildew. The floor was stained a tainted shade of yellow. The room sizzled with nervous whisperings and squeaking chairs.
			It was nearly lunch hour, and a good portion of the men had lost all faith and left in a tizzy. “What kind of goddamn master books a shit-hole like this and shows up hours late!” they thought to themselves as they skidded out of the parking lot. As for the remaining men, they clung to the last tethers of hope, and as their hope withered and the ache of abandonment began to scream in their intestines—the lights went out in the auditorium… It was pitch fucking black. The whispering seized, and a piercing silence fell on the room. The men’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a few of them noticed something moving in their periphery… and then all of them noticed… a shadowy figure limped slowly towards the center of the stage.
			A circular, almost cartoonish spotlight clicked on and standing as still as a statue in the dead center of the light was a short, crinkled black man with a round gut. The gut hung lazily over his flowing, black velvet pants. What was left of his hair was frazzled and greying. He appeared to be in his mid-70s. His eyes scanned the room, his body remained motionless.
			Soft whisperings surfaced from the silence as the men appraised the static, velvet creature. “Surely this cannot be the master?! Where is our young, toned pussy slayer?! Where is He with a cock like thunder and the triceps of a mule?” a doubter whispered.					“What a disaster his jawline! What a ruse his vitality!” another chimed in. 
			Then, like an eruption, deep bellowing laughter surged through the speakers, echoing through the auditorium. When the last trail of the Velvet Man's laughter faded, there were exactly three seconds of a deadly hush, and then, with a deep and slow Southern draw, The Master spoke… 
			“You fucking cunts, look at you all… traveling from the edges of Earth, shelling the last of your humble earnings for a chance at a little pussy. You have been scammed yet again. But take solace in knowing you have helped me greatly. My debts are paid, and my future secure. I will not waste one penny of your hard earned money. I shall spend the rest of my days traveling to exotic islands, drinking the strongest liquors, and bedding the most beautiful harlots this world has ever birthed. I appreciate every one of you. You may go now.” 
			A scrawny man with a bowl cut took to his feet.
			“How dare you! How dare you swindle us in the hour of our greatest desperation! Burn in hell you old bandit!” he screeched. His body shook like an old motor on its last mile. A tear rolled down his face. The Master wailed in amusement. 
			“God strike this old devil with Syphilis and Scabies! Make him pay! Make his last days hellfire!” howled another naysayer.
			The Master clapped joyfully along to the men’s ranting and then, in a cool and calm voice replied, 
			“Yes, yes. That’s the spirit. The Good Lord has heard your request and added it to his To-Do list. You, too, are dismissed.” 
			Raul watched as the dejected men rose to their feet, steaming and screaming as they cast their stones at the stage. He wondered for which of these men it was the final straw, the last faint glimmer of hope being  devoured by the all-consuming darkness. Surely tomorrow there would be the news: “Heartbroken Simpleton, 31, found dead in a river.” Who would be the first to take that great leap? 
			One by one, the men shuffled towards the exit, cursing under their breath at themselves and the world. Raul continued to watch the men without moving. He was nine hundred miles from home with nowhere to go, nothing left to lose. His rage was exhausted. He had no will to stand, or leave, and so, he sat.  
			Within a few short moments, a room of over a thousand men had withered to thirty seven. The Master took off his shoes, sat down on the floor in the lotus position, tapped the microphone twice, and said, 
			“Now let us begin.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The Master set his cup back down on the floor and cracked his knuckles. As the old bones in his fingers crunched, he exhaled deeply. 
			Gregory raised his hand and again, began to speak before being addressed.
			“Sir, if there is one thing that truly confuses me, it is the age old battle of the ‘nice guy’ and the ‘asshole’.. Can you tell us once and for all if it’s true that the nice guy finishes last and the asshole gets the snatch? My cousin Aadesh says I fail with the ladies because I am a nice guy and a pussy.”
			“The asshole, the nice guy… again your Mechanical Mind is just looking for molds and systems to make sense of the world, to make sense of culture. The goal is something Else entirely… the goal is to embody the fluidity and clarity of the Pimp. Besides, we must know it is not the label or name we give something that makes it What It Is. Every man in this room may call you Kapul, but what does it matter to you if your birth certificate says Gregory?” 
			“I understand, Master. But would you not agree in the simplest sense, in terms of one's attitude, it is better to inhabit the spirit of the asshole as opposed to the nice guy?” 
			“It is not the asshole that has value to the woman. You are conflating the jeweler with the diamonds held in his pockets. In the pocket of the asshole, you will find boldness, confidence, a strong Will, strict boundaries of what he will and will not tolerate, a mind that values its time and energy, a fearless demeanor when facing the world and all foes, a man who gives no fucks for the opinions of others, a man who seeks no validation from a woman... And why are these qualities enticing to the woman?”
			“They show strength, Master,” Gregory replied.
			“Yes strength, obviously… but press deeper.”
			The Master paused for a moment hoping for an answer. He continued.
			“They create emotion! Emotion! Emotion!… they set the woman off on a electrifying inner-journey as she tries to capture the unattainable… and this is why assholes generally do well with women, but in regards to his success, it is these qualities alone that move the woman. Know that a man can have these qualities without being cruel or ugly. Imagine a man with these qualities pushing an innocent elderly woman down the escalator at the mall and high-fiving his friend. How many women are lined and up and begging to lay him?”
			“None,” the congregation of men agreed. 
			The Master nodded and continued.
			“And as for the nice guy… he is despised by women and the world because he cannot be trusted. His ‘niceness’ is almost always a ploy to get something he wants but is too weak to take. He offers no emotion or Magic because he is so selfishly consumed in his own world and what it is he wants, and how others perceive him to ever step in anyone else’s world. Now ask yourself, are you He? The man so self-consumed with being liked and unoffensive to others that he lacks all Presence?” 
			The men pretended to ponder the question, knowing damn well they were He.
			“So if a man wants to be decent, and has some ethics, where does that leave him sir?”
			“Beyond! Beyond the asshole and the nice guy. Know that one can be simultaneously decent, and give of himself to the world and his fellow man, and still be bold and badass, still slay a beast at the drop of a hat, still tease the shit out of a woman and clap her cheeks in the bathroom at the local diner before the pancakes arrive. This is the way of the Pimp. He exists in a league of his own creation.”
			“Master, I will admit I am the ‘nice guy’ type, for sure. To better understand, can you explain how this plays out in the real life interaction between men and women?” said a zealous man in the front row. 
			“When men and women are together, there is always some subtle aspect of sex lurking… the polarities of the masculine and feminine have this draw towards each other ingrained. When you are with a woman you have no attraction to, or a woman is with a man she has no attraction to, this draw of polarities recedes and may be more or less extinguished, and the two can carry on as friends or associates... but when there is an attraction there, on a subconscious level or conscious level, or both simultaneously, these energies begin to Dance. And what is this Dance? It is the motion, the push and pull, the tension of these two energies moving together rhythmically, side to side, but also forward in direction.. and where is it moving forward towards? Where does it lead?”
			The Master waited for a response, but the men had none. They were still trying to put it all together. He continued.
			“The nice guy is not even aware of the Dance’s existence, and because he is not aware of it on a conscious level, there is no chance for sex to happen, as it takes the conscious aspect of the Dance to fuel the interaction forward towards sex and union. He is so consumed with coming across pleasantly and making a good impression, that there is no action, no tension, no Magic… only reaction to both the woman and the world around him. He is soft and flaccid, and as he inhabits this frame of being the reactor, the receiver, more passive in nature, he has moved fully into the Feminine like the woman. And naturally, like everything under the sun, Universal Law says these energies of the same vibration will repel. The woman says 'My! This beer tastes like urine!’ The man who chose and ordered them yelps ‘Why yes they do my lady! Just terrible! My apologies—let me get us another round.’ The woman says ‘I can’t get enough of this band playing tonight!’ The man, who knows the music is shit, replies ‘Oh my god! They’re so good right?!’ She asks him if he ‘always gels his hair like that?’ and unaware as to whether her comment is a compliment or a cutdown, he assumes the worst and becomes anxious, ‘Well… no… I... just here and there I guess… but it probably looks better when it’s dry... I don’t know?’ For the man is telling the truth, he does not have any conviction in his hair, or anything else in life.”
			Judas discretely tapped at his gelled top to feel the placement and status of his hair. He quietly looked to the men next to him to see if they noticed, but their eyes were glued on the Master. 
			“Towards the end of this dreadful night, they sit at a table by the bar, and a moment of silence begins to blossom and the man, terrified of the Void, thrusts his voice forward, ‘So... when are you free next? I’ve had a great time and would love to see you again.’ The woman’s face contorts as she tries her best to camouflage every fiber of her being cringing in agony. She replies ‘Hmm… I’m not too sure. I have a lot going on the next couple weeks but let’s keep in touch.’ Do you see how pathetic and soul-crushing this scene is? Are you aware that this man has a better shot at hitting the Mega-Millions than bedding or dating this woman? Do you understand that if this man had simply inversed every word, every look, every move he made tonight, he would have faired far better by default? This is why I am telling you that if every one of your interactions with women plays out the same way, there is something much deeper that needs to be addressed in You.”
			“Sir, it appears you have been eaves dropping on my dates!” remarked one of the converted men playfully. 
			“Hell! Mine too! Now tell us of the Pimp, Master,” chimed another enthusiastic man.
			“As for the Pimp, his night with the same woman looks very different, so much so that if the other man saw it unfold, he would have no clue as to what was Unfolding and would not believe his eyes. The Pimp sets a date with the woman at a bar a five minute walk from his house, as the location makes certain possibilities much more... possible. He’s also aware of the edge he has socially in this atmosphere as it is his ‘home court.’ And because he’s a bit preoccupied finishing a Python code he has been working on all week, tending to his true calling in life, he unintentionally shows up thirteen minutes late. He approaches the table casually, in a pair of old jeans and a nondescript t-shirt, with no apparent anxiety over his tardiness.. and as he takes a seat next to the woman, she says to him ‘Well well well, nice of you to have shown up. I was about to leave,’ and the man replies ‘Oh cut me some slack… I was getting all done up for you.' Notice the subtle push: he shows up late with no remorse, and the pull: he jokes that it was only because he was trying to impress her. An obvious fib and tease that simultaneously disarms her ego, mocks flattery, and reasserts the ‘Man to Woman’ sexual dynamic established in their initial communications. She can sense immediately that this man knows how to Dance and that he is not going to be like the last seven impotent schlubs she went out with. He immediately presents some level of challenge to her. Are you with me?”
			The congregation of men nodded in unison. They were fully enthralled, as if for the first time seeing behind a curtain into a hidden world they knew existed but never understood.
			The Master carried on.
			“A few minutes later, a feisty young lady the man has dated in the past drunkenly approaches the table and says ‘Look who it is? Does your parole officer know you’re here?’ The silly young lady, not understanding her own breed’s psychology, thinks her comment will act as some sort of quasi cock-block to the man, but only adds fuel to the fire… the emotional landscape of the woman sitting next to him is now ablaze with curiosity and intrigue. She also feels a subtle tinge of jealousy in the left side of her gut, as her keen intuition tells her these two have definitely slept together. The man sets down his drink and in no rush responds to the young drunk lady ‘Luckily he is of no concern.. twenty bucks goes a long ways these days.’ The young drunk lady stands frozen. She has been outwitted and her attack, vaporized. She stares at him for a moment, and he is unmoved. She is out of ammunition, accepts defeat, and stumbles off into the night. ‘Parole?’ his date playfully jeers. ‘Only petty crimes, mostly harmless,’ the man replies… And why does he respond in this manner?”
			“Because he knows that the straight answer holds no Magic or Feeling,” Raul retorted.
			The Master grinned and shook his fist with mirth.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“Yes, exactly… because he is aware that the Question is far more seductive than the answer, and that ambiguity and aloofity makes the heart of the female grow fonder... Now as the man and woman begin to explore and get to know each other at the table, we hit the mute button, and watch the energy and deeper Language being spoken: we see the man lean in slowly, pause, and whisper something in her ear, the woman tries to hold back but fails—she bursts into laughter and slaps him on the shoulder. She leans in and whispers something back. Her eyes look up to him, searching for affirmation and approval of her notion. He smiles coyly, shakes his head, and takes a big gulp from his whiskey. His eyes casually scan the bar to reappraise their surrounding. He is loose and relaxed, and her body is angled into him. Their shoulders are touching now, and the man ever so subtly inches his arm away from hers—the ever so subtle Push.. but she is all Pull now, and we see her arm compensate the half inch gap… their arms are now touching again. You can feel the rhythm in their energies... back and forth, and the Dance goes on.”
			The Master paused for a beat.
			“Are we dancing gentlemen? Can you Feel what is Unfolding here?”
			The flock nodded. 
			The Master continued.
			“Twenty minutes later, he grabs her by the hand and lifts her, “Come, it’s time you show me how to dance.” Notice the way this man Moves—fully present in the moment, still and centered in his masculine essence, leading the woman, taking action, while continuously softening and disarming her ego and anxieties by peppering in the occasional warm and subtle Pull, be it verbal or physical. His validations are not overt, but of a playful and sparing nature—vague enough to leave uncertainty in the mind of the woman, never quite answering the lingering question of what he actually thinks of her. Notice the way he holds the frame of the interaction and puts the pressure—and the ‘proving’—on her. Notice how he flips the script and transforms the old ‘man impresses woman’ adage right on its head. She is aware he has no care for her approval or validation, and it makes her pine for his all the more. He has released the woman back into her natural habitat of simpotry... For this is the art of charm. This is how the Pimp Dances with a woman.”
			The Master began to gently sway and rotate his hips as if pressed up on an invisible dime piece.
			"Now they are on the dance floor, literally dancing. She feels his hands grip the skin of her waist—no hesitation, no fear—and she tingles. She rests her lips softly against his neck and inhales his essence. She peers over his shoulder and notices all the simps and reactors sitting at the bar watching them dance... they are alone on the floor… alone in the world, and she loves every moment of it… for she is enraptured in the arms of a man who is One with himself—whose essence she can trust. A man who makes her Feel all sorts of things. A man who’s Being she is aching to explore, and a man she is fairly certain she is going to fuck the living shit out of. A mere hour and thirty-six minutes into their encounter and her mind is made up. ‘Take me, you wild stallion,’ she thinks to herself. And the Pimp senses this, he feels it in her touch, and sees it in the glaze in her eye… the soft glow of her skin… ‘It is time,’ he says to himself. So the man—’’
			A lanky fella launched up out of his chair, quivering in pure terror. He interjected frantically— 
			“Sir! This man next to me has an erection! I... I cannot sit next to him another moment!! I must move seats! Forgive my interruption but I’m sure you understand Master!” 
			The Master raised his eyebrow. There was whispering among the men. 
			“Which one of these men next to you is erect?” howled The Master.
			“It is I, Master.” murmured a soft voice. 
			The man stood up. It was Gregory. He looked down at his crotch in shame, both at the occasion and meagerness of his protrusion. He spoke solemnly,
			“If any consolation, sir… gentleman… I don’t believe it is a gay erection… it is just that Master’s story telling is quite vivid.. his movements so sensual… he captured my emotions and I apologize,” he said softly.
			The Master was tickled. He hooted a good hoot. 
			“Apologize? Someone give this man a high five... for his erection is the proof that he is Here… Awake in this Moment, submerged in the teachings… we pass no judgements on the way nature expresses itself, be it gay or… purely mechanical,” the Master said calmly. 
			The Master looked back to the uncomfortable, complaining man. 
			“You may move your seat... six inches closer to him.” 
			“Sir?” gulped the lanky fellow with befuddled disgust. 
			“You heard me… his little erection is not going to harm you… you said where you’re seated now makes you uncomfortable, so I am telling you to move your chair closer to him,” quipped the Master. 
			“Sir I came here to learn about women, and seduction, not to play homosexual Jedi mind games! This is absurdity! All of it!” said the man, now on the verge of tears.
 			“Then leave! Be gone already! You are far too rigid in mind and too weak in spirit for a Path like this!” 
			The Master shewed him with his hand, and the bitch man scampered off towards the exit.
			“Let us proceed… where did we leave off?” said the Master. 
			“Master, from the outside the maneuvers of charismatic pimp almost do seem Magic. Like he is putting a hex on the woman.. Something about it feels… dare I say… sinister… or Machiavellian,” a man replied.
			“What you fail to realize is that this man was not putting on a performance. He was only Doing what he Does. Yes he was aware of where he was leading the situation, but in no way to the detriment of the woman, as she came to meet this man with a far off hope that this is exactly the way he would be, and what would Unfold. The Pimp is well aware of this. Ask yourself… do you think this woman spent hours primping and grooming every inch of her body and mind in hopes he would be another dickless dunce? That she would have to spend another night exchanging bullshit pleasantries with some spineless slug who did not speak her Language or make her Feel anything? The behavior of the simp man was far more calculated and manipulative, yet you take no issue with he? There is nothing evil or malevolent about The Dance. Like I said before, if it was not for men like him your species would cease to exist! The Gods cheer for this man… You must understand, this is the reason why a small fraction of the men on this Earth do all the loving and fucking.”
			“But Master, to draw a woman in such a powerful way, is there really no danger here?” objected the man.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“Does she see her perfect narrow nose, or the immaculate angle that her eyes rest in her face? No… she sees her blemishes, and how her left lip hangs a pin head lower than her right. She stares and wonders how any one of your kind could ever truly love her. She wonders if you will see through her mascara, see what lies beneath, and if one day you won’t leave for a younger, more vivacious woman, or a woman that has something she does not. And in the midst of this great Fear, this web of screeching flies in her mind, her stomach starts to churn and kick from last night’s tequila and burger parfait.. and she races for the toilet, thumps down her sweet ass, grips the seat with all her mite, and unleashes a holocaust of shit and piss... and a stench like death—like a thousand bodies rotting in the sun—detonates in the air. She dabs the beads of sweat off her forehead, stands and wipes herself with the lone sheet of toilet paper left on the roll, and exits the bathroom without washing her hands. Her phone dings in the kitchen and she is struck with a burst of anticipation and emotion… ‘Maybe it is the Great Kapul! I have not heard back from him in three weeks! Please, Gods of Love, I beg of you, let it be the Great Kapul!’ 
			Gregory tried to hold back, but the Master’s validation was too sweet a taste. He cracked a big smile.
			“But it is not the Great Kapul… it’s our Kapul, sending his fifth pathetic message of the day, along with an infantry of other simpletons who speak to her in a foreign language.”
			Gregory’s smile collapsed in slow motion.
			The Master continued.
			“Her excitement crumbles, and she returns to the mirror in search of the blemishes she missed earlier.”
			Raul caught a flicker of tenderness in the Master’s eyes—just for a moment—as if recounting a woman’s battles had stirred in him some ancient sorrow for all of humanity.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">“She is not the enemy. She is just like me!” Shouted the men devoted men. 
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” yelled The Master.
			“She is not the way! She does not know the way!” chanted the choir. 
			“She shits and she does not always wash!”
			“She shits and she does not always wash!” they roared! 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“I alone hold the key to my freedom and bliss!” 
			“Very good,” said the Master. 
			“Hold tight to the mantra, men! The mantra is all we need!” shouted the chubby man with the lisp.
 			The Master threw his hand up in the air to halt the blossoming of a false notion.
			“No! For this is just the beginning! This is only one mantra, one practice, one compartment of the Mind. We will not stop here… We must eliminate not just the Web of the Woman, but every web you have ever spun!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“Speak to us more of… the… Tests along the way, Master. It seems as if… as if… all of life itself is just one Test… after… another..” said the ginger man with a waver in his voice.
			“As I said before, the Tests of life, of the woman.. they are not the enemy. They are not a force of evil. They are your friend. They are there to aid and propel your evolution. Like everything else we have discussed today, the first step is to recognize and be conscious of the tests. Let’s go back to the woman, as her tests are relentless and a metaphor for all of life tests. The woman’s tests are a constant and endless check on man as to whether he is centered in himself and his Mission. The majority of you are here because you fail the very first test of the woman, and that is having a basic conviction in yourself. Her entire evolution has wired her to smell your bullshit from a mile away, as her evolutionary survival depended on it. You approach her and she senses your fear and incongruence, she senses you have no direction in your step, and her subconscious mind sounds the alarm: ‘He is afraid and shook by a 140-pound girl that wishes him no harm.. what will the world do to him?!’ And she is right!”
			The Master was in the Zone. The pace of his speech picked up as he continued.
			“Now let’s say you have some semblance of conviction and competence and you have begun dating a woman for a few months, and she says to you ‘I think its silly your refrigerator is full of sauces and find it a bit embarrassing to see you going door to door like a peasant trying hustle your sauce. My father said he would give you a real job.’ What does the average man do? He quits, in fear he may lose her... and on the surface she is happy, because here is a man that was so afraid to lose her, he gave up on The Mission. She feels validated in her Womanly Woo and influence, but beneath the surface, deep in her soul she is repulsed, and her attraction withers. The man was swayed from his own Will and Path by an outside opinion and a few unpleasant comments… How many of you have been this man? How many of you are still He?”
			Raul was the first to raise his hand. He had always been this man, oblivious to the glaringly obvious. His newfound clarity on a world once shrouded in mystery and chaos was truly emancipating. 
			The Master signaled for the men to put down their hands as he continued the teaching.
			“Know that she will plunder you with a barrage of trivial tests too, from the ‘I don’t like this song. Change it,’ to the ‘You would never really vote for that man, would you?’ All these can be translated into the same question ‘Are you a Pimp or a bitch? Are you about that life or are you not?’ And the correct answer is always your Truth, your Will, what you Want for Yourself... no matter how offended or disgruntled it may make her on the surface, know that on a deeper level you sticking to your guns and standing where you Choose to stand is what draws her closer and makes her gain trust in you as a man. And as for the true Pimp…”
			The Master smiled a devious smile.
			“The true Pimp who understands all of this knows how to flip the script on her entirely. He is on a date with a woman and starts deploying his own tests and challenges before she even has a chance to set the age old ‘I’m the woman and you are here to impress me… now here’s your first test’ frame. She scrambles as her Mechanical Mind is not used to being in such a peculiar and compromising position. He is tickled to see the true simp come out in her.. ‘No, no!’ she says, ‘I only went to see Maroon 5 because my friend had bought the tickets!’ The pimp chuckles in amusement and pokes at her, ‘Riiiiiight.. Check please!” 
			“Brilliant, sir! But… how on Earth is the woman so damn crafty? How many hours a day does she scheme on the man?” said a spirited young man.
			The Master had a good laugh at this. 
			“No, no… the vast majority of the time, a woman’s test are not consciously concocted. She is not off in some dark alley trading ‘catch the man’ tests with other women… The testing is wired and of an evolutionary nature. It is a survival mechanism of her subconscious mind to weed out the simps and weaklings from the true Pimps... and it is for this reason that her tests are not always easy to recognize... as you will not sense any level of deception or fuckery in the delivery of her tests… but know that until you have proved unwavering conviction in yourself and your Path, her tests, and the world’s tests, will not cease. Again, we must not see this is a burden, but a gift and service to keep you on your toes and steadfast on the Mission. Know that just like the undertaking of the Mission, we are not out to pass a woman’s tests to keep the woman or please the woman, we pass these tests for ourselves, for our own evolution. Her attraction is just a symptom.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">The Master stood and began to walk elegantly from one side of the stage to the other as he spoke.
			“Right now in this very moment there are millions of men all over the world shouting ‘that fucking savage bitch! How could she?!’ Oh the chumps, if they had any Understanding of Reality, they would be thanking the woman for leaving, as there are two main ways a woman exits a man’s life against his wishings, and both are a gift to the man. The first way is if the woman was no good, and did something unforgivable… She blew his cousin or lied about her entire past… in which case he thanks her for taking out the trash and freeing him from her depravity. The second way, the more tragic of the two, is when she leaves because the man is weak or has moved into his feminine and her attraction disintegrates to nothingness… and begrudgingly, he must thank her for shining a light on this weakness and the chinks in his armor. For the pain inflicted by her exit serves as a baptism by fire and inspires a growth in him. This is how the Aware man deals with these scenarios. Unfortunately, for the majority of men, still anchored in their Mechanical Minds, they blame her and the world and fall further into the abyss of impotence and lifelessness. It is for this reason that the average disgruntled man sees the woman as the enemy, as his adversary. He has no awareness that her role in his narrative is to aid the blossoming of the true Power in him, by any means necessary. He makes getting the woman and keeping her his mission, he becomes reactive and emotional, he moves fully into his Feminine, and this repels her.” 
			The Master stopped his pacing and turned to the men. He stared straight out at them and spoke earnestly.
			“The truth is that a woman does not want to be man’s Mission, she does not want to be the center of his universe, or the reason he gets out of bed in the morning... She may say it is so, but Understand, it is never, ever so.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how did you come to understand this truth?</p>

<p class="master">“I understand that may be the case Master, but I must admit, no amount of logic or reasoning seems to dull the pain. I still am absorbed in the pain. It is unwavering.. and I cannot see myself with anyone else but her... how can one deal?” 
			“Again you are only living in the truth of the Now, of the emotion you feel in this very moment. And those emotions will fade and morph into new emotions in time. Can you acknowledge this?”
			“Yes. Yes I understand, sir,” replied the sorrowful man.
			“Let’s start with addressing the core feeling you are left with: aloneness. You imagine that gut wrenching heartbreak you feel is unlike anything anyone else on this Earth could ever imagine. But you must know it is an ignorant and arrogant thought... Almost every single person you pass on the street has felt that same all-consuming pain. They have lost someone they held just as dear, yet there they are, marching on… many of them with new partners or love interests. I want you to look at every one of those people, really look at them, and know they came out the other side, and your fate will be the same. With this simple awareness in the mind let's move on to the real work: cutting out the web and imprint this woman has left behind.”
			The Master rubbed his hands together and rolled his neck.
			“Just as you have spun your webs of fear, you have spun a web with this woman. I want you to sit down at a table with a pen and pad... go back in your mind to the very first girl you ever loved or had a passionate crush on… all the way back.. It may have been kindergarten or 2nd grade. Now, write down her name. Go through all the years of your life, and write down all the names. Don’t skip a single love or infatuation.. You should have fifteen, thirty, fifty names on your list. At the bottom, the last name you will add to the list is the one who just broke you. Now starting with the very first name on the list, the very first girl you loved… I want you to see her in your mind’s eye. There are borders framing this memory of her... push on the boarders of this memory, look outside the frame. Step all the way in it, remember the way she smelled, and the tone of her voice... feel that rush of life and love you felt when you were near her... the tingle that ran up the back of your neck when you sat next to her in math class and your arms brushed lightly upon each others. Remember how much you loved her, and how in the moment you could have never imagined feeling that way about any other girl. When you are fully submerged in the feeling, when all that Magic has hit you again, let it fade. Step back outside the memory and back to the now. Watch as all that passion, all that love, the whole trip dissolves back into the nothingness of the Now. Go through every name on your list and repeat the process. Notice the world of love and emotion you had for each woman and how with time and each new Love Trip, the prior woman faded into oblivion. Now look at the last name on the list, the one who just broke you, and See that she is just another name on the list. Know that like all the others, her influence on your emotional state is destined to fade and give way to a new name. See the whole thing, the whole list for what it is: an emotional Trip. Realize that each name is but an emotional oasis in a desert of the mundane. Look at that list and ask yourself: what is this? What is this about? Is this evolving list of romantic entanglements ‘It’? Is this the highest pursuit of a man’s life?”
			The Master paused, and tilted his head.
			“That is not a rhetorical question. Is this man’s greatest pursuit?!”
			“No!” they shouted.
			“Should this impermanent dance be the center of my universe and dictate the way I live and operate? Man must ask himself if he wants to spend his short and fragile life hunting for the cheese in the closet or pushing Beyond... evolving his spirit… if this was all just about women and pussy, you could be falling in love and screwing your brains out in a whore house right now… I think each of you is aware by now that mastery with women is just a symbol, a metaphor for a bliss and conquering of Something much Greater in your life.”
			“The pain aside, how does one deal with the betrayal? The idea of my girl being penetrated by another man… it haunts my dreams,” exclaimed the heart-broken man.
			“Let’s first look at this Fear very closely. You are afraid of your woman going to bed with another man. The idea of another man penetrating your little pumpkin pie is like a knife in your gut. But why? What about this scene is so haunting? You’re well aware she has most likely had an army of penises inside her before you were together? And those cause you no agony? So we can deduce from this logic that it is not the idea of another man penetrating your woman that is the issue. The issue is her taking another man’s penis after You were there. And if we prone a bit more we find that the real Fear is that some man after you will be More than you. He will be more charismatic, or more talented, or better looking, or have a bigger pipe.. And because there is a chance he is More, you feel less than... you feel inferior, inadequate, weak, unlovable.. So the heart of this matter isn’t in her or him, or his penis inside of her… it lies in you, and the way you feel about and perceive yourself. Know this fear will not cease, the nightmares will not cease, until something major has changed in You. Now we could give you more systems, more practices, another mantra to help cut this web from the mind, but you men must realize by now, the webs you have spun are endless, and it is going to be on you to use the blueprint and framework of our prior practices to guide your way.”</p>
