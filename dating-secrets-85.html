                <p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“You are missing the point. When a man has transformed into the Pimp, there is no way around this draw. It is natural, and inevitable. Until man has been Reborn into this higher version of himself, and while his maneuverings are still conscious and strategic, there are, however, great implications. With great power comes great responsibility… You must always be conscious she is human just like you, and to continue to intentionally Move her and keep her on a Ride when you have no real interest in her is in fact a dangerous and sadistic game. I am not here to be your ethical compass or tell you how to behave in the world, only to teach you the Truth. What you do with it is up to you…The man you want to be is your choice, and yours alone. With that said, you should understand that we are striving to move beyond the realm of maneuverings and manipulations… and the thing that were are striving to Become happens to be exactly the thing the woman yearns for. There is no conflict here… the goal is the same whether she existed or not.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">The Master took a deep breath and the fire returned to his voice.
			“Do you see Her now? Do you Understand the Reality of the creature that once made you tremble in fear? How could this creature ever Hurt you? What could she ever Take from you? Sear this image in your mind, picture it day and night, let it be the first thing you see in the morning, the last thing you see at night.. let it paint the skies of every dream you dream... and in time, the software of your mind that deals with women will take on a new shape, a new perception… one that is more in line with Reality… one that can immerse itself in a new Language… and as the script of this software is rewritten, the other softwares of the Mind too become more malleable, more unsure of themselves, and easier to adjust or destroy. This process is a key aspect of the evolution from man to Pimp… Now repeat after me: She is not the enemy. She is just like me!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“This... sir.” said the timid ginger man with a tremble. 
			“This… this… what? Speak up!” said the Master. 
			“To… to… be put… on the spot… to speak pu… publicly.” he stammered. 
			“Ah! One of the most common, and irrational fears! For there are many men who would jump in shark infested waters before having to speak publicly… and what is the fear here? The fear is that you will be Found Out. That you will be Seen. Man can put on a front and lie to himself in the mirror moderately convincingly for damn near a lifetime, but when all of the Eyes are on him, the Truth is much harder to hide. Subconsciously the man knows, they may See me. They may see beyond my ego and see the real totality of me… Every lie, every heinously selfish act, every disgusting thought that has spun in my mind late at night… the shame, the guilt… you cannot run from it… it is all There. So the speaking in front of others, it is a reflection, a metaphor of a much larger Thing. Yes, you can learn a few breathing exercises or join a group of others with the same phobia and go ‘on the spot’ more… and yes your heart may stop racing from a simple process of repeated immersion that ends with your survival, and you may conquer the micro-fear of the actual speaking, but you will never get to the root… and like a hellish weed, it will rear it’s head in a new outfit, a new scene... the world will find other ways to Remind you that you must face Yourself... you must surrender… Now my ginger friend, how can you go about such a vast and abstract thing as facing Yourself?”
			The little ginger man’s face turned blood red. 
			“Ginger Snap, every morning when you wake up I want you set an alarm for five minutes and look in a mirror directly at Yourself. Stare deep into your own eyes. As you go about your day, I want you to bring your mind back to this vision of yourself. Simultaneously, I want you to find a stranger on the internet, or some old woman feeding geese in a park, and begin by telling this stranger Everything. The things in your life that you have never told a soul, from the ugliest, most hideous thoughts and acts, to the most beautiful, to the most bizarre… tell them of the most major betrayal you have ever committed on behalf of another, and the one committed on you. Tell them about what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror. I am saying reveal Yourself to someone! Anyone! Drop the social games, and the ego, and for a single moment, and just be Real. For this single experience, this single moment of Realness alone is enough to start a transformation in a man.” 
			The little ginger man made an ‘Okay’ gesture with his hand and nodded his head. 
			“Say it out loud! Let us hear your voice!”
			“Okay,” said the man sheepishly.
			“We do not want to hurt you. We are all in this together. Louder!” howled the Master.
			“OKAY,” the ginger man yelled with gusto.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“Let’s hear it for Judas, everybody!”
			The men began to whistle and clap with an enthusiastic, whimsical glee, as if Judas had just won twenty thousand in cash on “The Price is Right.” 
			Judas’s eyes filled with hysteria as he watched, mortified at the tortuous hell-realm spectacle he had created. The men were staring at him, still smiling and clapping and laughing in slow motion. The Bells were finally ringing. It was the Finale of Judas— the last scene in the film of “Who he Thought He Was.” The credits rolled.
			Raul watched Judas closely. And despite the contempt he’d felt for the man all day, something deeper rose in him—empathy. He, too, knew what is was like to be trapped inside such a despicable prison of persona with no idea of how to escape. 
			The Master resumed his place on the stage as if he had never left. 
			“Now, now! Where were we? Ah! Yes… The Fear! Let’s take one more look... with you Gregory… of all the beings on Earth, who is it you fear the most? Besides the woman, whose presence makes your heart race and breathe run short?” 
			“In classic Indian fashion, it is my father and mother, sir. No matter what it is I do, it never seems enough. They had hopes I would become a doctor, and marry a pretty girl and have many children, like my brother. I fear them greatly, and my voice quivers every time I have to tell them I am still single and childless...” 
			“Ironically you did become a doctor, a healer of machines, a noble and respectable pursuit. Could they not see this? For they have passed down an ancient and irrational fear that does not serve You, or any of your culture for that matter. So we must confront this fear in the most aggressive and Mind shattering way. Gregory.. tomorrow night, when the clock strikes 3 A.M., I want you to call your parents, and on the sixth ring, when your father groggily answers the phone you say to him, ‘Father I have quit my job! I am moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and theatre! Do not worry though, one of my sugar daddies has a very nice home there and will provide for me!’ and hang up the phone... After you hang up the phone, sit in silence and look around the room. Be fully aware you are still alive and in no danger, and that the world is spinning on. Ask yourself, in the scheme of the infinite, how much weight does another man’s opinion hold, be it your father's, or your neighbor, or that of a woman? Be aware that in the grand scheme of humanity and The Unfolding, absolutely nothing of substance has changed one iota. Your parents’ Fairy Tale wishings have been laid to rest, and  you are now free from their shackles. Take a deep breath and exhale all the unnecessary shame and guilt you have carried for so long. You are free of this burden now, Gregory. The web has lost its anchor, and in the space that all that fear and shame and hell once menaced, there is space now for all kinds of Magic and wonder to live.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">“Master... I… I don’t kn—“
			“Shush! You will or you won’t, Gregory. Know that in the grandest sense of it all, this is the One Real Question, the one real choice for man: Action or death. There is no halfway, no low-level pimp... One either takes Action and dives head first into the abyss or he submits to being another cog in the machine, another Mechanical Mind humming along through the scenes of life, pretending to be alive… At the heart of this all, at the core of everything said here today, understand that it is the Pimp who chooses Life, he who answers the Call with Action. You thought the Pimp was he who fucks women… I am telling you— it is the Pimp who fucks the shit out of life.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, many teachings seem contradictory. What is the truth?</p>

<p class="master">A small electronic device beeped on the Master’s hip. Master pushed his gut to the side, snatched the device, held it up close to his eyes and snickered. 
			“Well gentlemen, a dame so fine she could melt the paint off a Miata has called on me. I must go. You have been given enough. The true Pimp here will prove himself in time...Go get what it yours.” 
			The master saluted the men and limped off the stage. The men stood and clapped, hooting and shouting ridiculous things.
			“Go slay her Master! Break her back for us!”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">“Sammy Davis Jr., you are under arrest by the Federal Police of Justice for high crimes of the many. You have the right to remain silent as I hereby announce these crimes. Under the newly passed Federal Women’s Protection Act, in effect April 16th, pursuant code 769BBC, “Pimping" in all of its forms comes with a life sentence… The crimes you have committed under the umbrella of this law include: One… Unlawful disclosure of the Woman’s Psychology. Two… Manipulation of Historical Sexual Dynamics. Three… Radicalizing and Sexually Weaponizing Males. Four… Collecting money in Women Endangering Pursuits… last but not least, Five— using the word “Faggot” and “bitch” among other terms deemed unlawful. We have all of this on tape.” 
			The Master dropped his head and began to sob. 
			“But… but... I’m Black?" he whimpered.</p>
