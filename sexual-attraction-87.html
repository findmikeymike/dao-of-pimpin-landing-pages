                <p class="student">Master, can you teach me about this?</p>

<p class="master">“I want you to understand firstly, that the things you learn here today will look and sound foreign to you, illogical to you… maybe even impossible to you. But in those moments of reservation and trepidation at these uncomfortable new ideas, I want you to ask yourself — Has the way I have seen women and the world gotten me anywhere? Have my thoughts, beliefs, and actions led me to my destination, or have they left me hellbent and heartbroken? Ever since you were a small child, the world has fed you lies. The movies fed you Fairy Tales of the Princess and the incompetent neanderthal falling in true love and living happily ever after. Your mother told you to give her gifts and shower her with attention. The YouTube Guru told you to ‘make her laugh and get that ass.’ The Alpha Chad on the forums told you to ‘treat her like dirt and she’d stick like mud.’ The truth is none of them truly understand the deepest desire of the Woman or the way this world works. They have passed down to you nothing but chaos, confusion and outright falsehoods…”
			“But wh—” A man tried to interject. 
			The Master silenced the man with a swift hand.
			“—Why such confusion? That is what you want to know… It is not that they are trying to deceive you, it is that they have been deceived themselves. You see, to keep this realm we call Earth in existence, in motion, the Almighty Pimp created the Shadow of Man. It was the Shadow’s job to rig the deck, to sow confusion, to create conflict between man and himself.. man and the world… to keep man from evolving beyond his Mechanical Mind. For if man knew the Truth, if man was to evolve and liberate himself in large enough numbers, this whole motion picture would cease to exist, the Earth and human species would be no more… so The Lie was told and passed down from generation to generation, dispersed by cloaked figures and powerful men who do the bidding of the Shadow. We must first understand and acknowledge this. Only when The Lie is uncovered and erased, and a clean slate is left, does man have a chance to move beyond the Mechanical Mind and come to Understand… Understand life, women, Magic.. all of it…”
			The men appeared both puzzled and captivated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what is the essence of this teaching?</p>

<p class="master">“But to take a woman on the Ride, to purposely manipulate… is that not pure deception? Is it not just more confusion in the world? A bid for the Shadow?’ interjected an astute and doubtful man.
			“Ah! A thinker walks among us! A fair and important question… Understand this my friend, sex is warfare, and some wars are inevitable. The very nature of the act itself is rooted in an act of aggression, and almost every move to get it, by man or woman—a subconsciously concocted manipulation. You drive a nice car to manipulate her perception of your status. She applies her cherry lipgloss to make you dream of her wet, juicy snatch. If men and women did not play this game, and did not find ways to attract and conquer each other, it would be the death of their species, so would it be fair to call this evil? If it takes some level of seduction for sex to ever occur, is it fair to damn the one who Understands versus the one who guesses or succeeds by happenstance? If it is somehow ‘evil,' it is clearly a necessary and natural one set in motion by the Almighty Pimp himself… Just know, for man, this game—this calculated behavior—is only temporary. When a man becomes a Pimp, there is no manipulation, no deceit necessary. Your essence, your mission, your passion will provide for the ultimate Ride in and of itself. You will not go cold at the zenith of your conversation with a beautiful woman out of tactic. You will go cold on her and pop back in two weeks later because there is something in your life of far greater importance. Her presence will become a genuine afterthought on your journey, and then, and only then, can her power over you be destroyed.” 
			“Master, how does one embark on this Path and still hold onto Himself, though?” barked a chubby man with a lisp.
			The Master’s head fell and shook gently side to side.
			“Hold on to Himself? Is ‘He’ not the cause of all your troubles, and exactly why you are here today? Should the three-hundred -pound woman with buffalo sauce on her blouse and thick black hairs running down her thighs—who showers once a season and complains about everything—just ‘be herself’ and expect you to love and chase her to the edge of the Earth? Enough with the Fairy Tales! The truth is ‘Who You Are’ in this moment, to a woman and the world alike, is of no interest or value, he brings no life or Feeling to the party. ‘He’ has never taken you anywhere in life but because you have gotten to know him so well, become so comfortable with him, you are afraid to leave him behind, and explore what lies Beyond. You must understand that your personality is nothing more than a collection of thoughts, feelings, and ideas from the past. It is an illusion, created to give you a false sense of identity and position in the world. You cling to it for safety and comfort—and it hinders you!” 
			“You hear that? An imaginary bag of shit floating in the wind! That’s all we are… how charming, ” snarled the dark eyed Judas.
			The Master continued as if Judas was invisible.
			“Your essence is fluid and ever-evolving. ‘Who You Are’ is whoever you Choose to be in any given moment. There are no boundaries to You, no limitations other than the ones you have carved into your Mechanical Mind. So I say to you, lighten up… enjoy the freedom, embrace the fluidity, have a little fun with ‘Yourself.’ Go try on some new personalities and behaviors, be the thing most unnatural to you. As you begin to let go of the identity you once gripped so tightly, you will notice a powerful thing start to happen: you will get a little looser, get a little more jive in your step… you will begin to notice how the world and women react differently to your Presence. You will start to realize the reason for those reactions, and the energy that truly moves the world… and this new You—not wasting all its energy and power trying to protect an ego or clinging to an idea, will have room for Presence and Magic. Soon enough this new state of Being will become as genuine and One with you as your original state of simpotry and stiffness once was. No fakery, no mystical lines necessary… The world will try its goddamn best to push back, make you cave, make you crawl back into your old shell, but you have drunk the sacred juice from the labias of the Almighty fountain, the Pimp has been born, and there is no going back… The Simp may be who you are, who you were, but he can easily be erased, and replaced with whomever it is you Choose. Even you, Mr. Finklefeet…” 
			Judas snickered and shook his head.
			“Master, for one who is very tied to his past, his ego.. who is self-admittedly close minded and rigid in identity, how can he go about separating from the old Him?” said a smokey voiced believer.
			“Think to the Method actor. Immerse yourself in someone Else. Go get yourself a cowboy hat, cowboy boots, some Levi denim and Marlboro Reds and go be the cowboy for a few days, or weeks, or months… Define Who he is and what makes him tick. Fully inhabit and operate as him throughout your day. Pick up your groceries as He… Make phone calls to women as He… become He in every last sense. Over time, as the line between You and He gets blurry, when you do not know which name to respond to, or you find yourself doing his hyena laugh, or holding a fork with the other hand, the idea of Who You Are will become less definite, more flexible… You will most likely find that right off the bat, you are far smoother and at ease with women and the world, as there will be no need to protect the ego you spent thirty years constructing. There will be a deep sense of liberation, and you may even find you enjoy your life more as the cowboy… or the Catholic priest, or the androgynous narcoleptic trucker, or whoever the hell it is that gives your spirit new Life.”
			As the Master sat back down in the lotus position and sipped his water, Raul saw a kaleidoscopic montage of himself as an array of eccentric characters swirling in his mind’s eye. He hopped from vision to vision, trying on different outfits and attitudes, inhabiting different worlds and socializing with all kinds of colorful characters. He remembered being twenty two and coming home one day in a black leather Harley jacket and how mercilessly Julia, his first wife, laughed at him. ‘Raul, you damn fool! Those jackets are made for hot bikers, not janitors. Did you get a kickstand for your mop, too?’ Raul hadn’t yet told her about his desire to get an old motorcycle, or his fantasies of the two of them taking late-night rides to escape the monotony of their days. He remembered the next afternoon, when he stuffed this vision into the pocket of the jacket and handed it back to the owner of the pawn shop, and the owner saying ‘Clutch gotcha huh?’… and the look of confusion and mild disgust on the man’s face when he replied, “The clutch of my wife.” And oddly, he felt a certain sense of peace with the memory. There was Somewhere in him that said maybe it wasn’t over… Maybe hidden under piles of Barbara Streisand vinyl and weary old lamp shades, in some dusty storage room of that pawn shop on Dunlevy Avenue, the tasseled Harley jacket would still be there, waiting for him.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“That gay fellow was beating the breaks off your little sugar plumb huh? Tsk Tsk,” The Master snickered. 
			“He was not really gay, Master,” said the man. 
			“Yes… I’m aware,” replied the Master. He continued.
			“Maybe the woman lied about you being the ‘love of her life’ and maybe she was just a no good scoundrel, but more likely it may very well have been that in that particular moment, when the sun was hitting your face at just the right angle, and you were gazing in each others eyes, she truly felt that you were the love of her life… But that little Ride ended, and her emotions continued wandering in a new direction, and with it came a new reality. So what may have been her truth in the moment was not really the Truth. It’s for this same reason that the young lady you hit it off with so swimmingly at the bar last weekend never returned your message the next day. She was high on the music and the juice, but when she woke up the next morning she was in a completely different emotional reality, and all the warm feelings and heat you shared in the late hours of the night, gone. Hell, the next morning, that girl probably couldn’t pick you out of a lineup of one armed midgets, and little ol’ simp you is sitting there thinking about marrying the broad while you sip your coffee.”
			“So that is why I never heard back from her! How silly of me!” laughed the ginger man upon seeing the Light.
			“Let us understand, while this momentary emotional reality is more prominent in the feminine essence, men too operate in this way. Think of all the times you had some song you swore was the greatest song you had ever heard… you were walking around singing it all day, telling all your friends they must listen and two weeks later you heard a new song you couldn’t get enough of. Now this new number is your favorite song of ‘all time.' Were you lying when you told everyone the first song was the greatest record ever? No... It is just that things change, and with each passing day, you have a new Reality.. Your truth was of the moment. Basic attraction is no different. Men mistakenly believe it a concrete thing, and that if a girl is into him, she will always be into him. This is not so... attraction is a fluid thing, waxing and waning from moment to moment. Be it woman or man, know that anything rooted in emotion is only an expression of the Now, and even if said or expressed with sincerity in the moment, are not things to hold as Truth or to believe to be definitive. When we have parted ways with the Mechanical Mind and taken on the New Mind, the Pimp Mind, these principles and nuances of life become very obvious to us.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“Say one did want to win her back? How should he go about it? I’m not speaking of this woman, just in general.” 
			“Oh not this woman?! Ha! Now you think you are deceiving me—and the other men around you—but you are only deceiving and confusing Yourself ... and this is the great trap of Dishonesty. A man on the Path must do all he can to be clear, open, honest, and Real with himself and others—as tough as it may be at times. For in every act of deception a seed of its own Undoing is planted. No lie will go unaccounted for. In regard to ‘winning’ the woman back, what kind of prize is spoiled milk? You ‘win’ her back… and what? You think this woman would ever have any respect and loyalty to such a cowardly man? That her behavior would magically change? Your relationship with this woman is over. Done. Thank her whatever she Revealed to you about Yourself, and move on with your life. Men spend so much of their fragile time dealing with some thing of the past, rekindling an old affair with some sub-par woman, and little do they realize they are only digging a deeper hole for themselves. They will do anything to delay the inevitable pain, and only torture themselves more.” 
			The Master paused for a beat. 
			“Keep in mind this Truth: the reason you are so stuck on her is because she is the one you encountered. There are literally millions of women on this Earth that had you met in that very same moment you met this woman, you would be just as in love with, just as broken over. Your pain and pining is because your Mechanical Mind sees a distorted Reality. You think it is about her, everything is about her, when it is really about You.”
			The Master stepped to the very front of the stage and spoke very solemnly.
			“She is only a key… a key that unlocks a space of love and beauty within Yourself. The Love, the Beauty, the Feeling… the entire journey… it is happening from Within You… A man must make and use his own key.. for if he lets the woman—or the world be his key, he will be on The Ride for eternity.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how can I apply this wisdom in my life?</p>

<p class="master">When Raul got home, he sank into the couch and pulled the brown envelope from his pocket. He unfolded the envelope and placed it on the table in front of him. 
			As he replayed the Magic and adventure of the day, he became curious about so many things. How did the Master know my name? I never even spoke it… and I used a fake name when I signed up? Where was Master from? How many able Pimps were out there?…  He even wondered what the fake legal documents detailing his ‘crimes of Pimping’ might look like, and how clever the Master’s final Test was. He thought about framing the document and posting it in his bedroom as a constant reminder of The Path. 
			Raul tore the envelope and reached inside. He pulled out a folded sheet of paper and read aloud to himself:</p>
