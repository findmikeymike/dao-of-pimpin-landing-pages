                <p class="student">Master, can you share your deeper wisdom on this topic?</p>

<p class="master">“You are missing the point. When a man has transformed into the Pimp, there is no way around this draw. It is natural, and inevitable. Until man has been Reborn into this higher version of himself, and while his maneuverings are still conscious and strategic, there are, however, great implications. With great power comes great responsibility… You must always be conscious she is human just like you, and to continue to intentionally Move her and keep her on a Ride when you have no real interest in her is in fact a dangerous and sadistic game. I am not here to be your ethical compass or tell you how to behave in the world, only to teach you the Truth. What you do with it is up to you…The man you want to be is your choice, and yours alone. With that said, you should understand that we are striving to move beyond the realm of maneuverings and manipulations… and the thing that were are striving to Become happens to be exactly the thing the woman yearns for. There is no conflict here… the goal is the same whether she existed or not.</p>

<p class="student">Master, I've tried many approaches but failed. What am I missing?</p>

<p class="master">“So he picks up the phone he has not touched in days and pulls up some women. One of the women in his log catches his eye and he rescans their prior conversation to see where they are in the Dance. Then he says to himself ‘the heat has risen enough, it is time to move dance floors,’ so he sends her a link to some exciting music act playing at a small venue only a short walk from where he lives. The only text he sends: ‘The first five rounds are on you.’ Notice this man speaks as if it is already in motion. He does not write the woman paragraphs or get into unnecessary detail. He doesn’t feign for rapport or try to make her laugh. He texts her as if she an after-thought in his life, which she is. The event isn’t for another two weeks, but he does not give a shit because he has his Mission to attend to, and other women to see, and over time he has learned that patience and the long game with beautiful women is the way of the Pimp. The woman receives his message, elated to hear back from him, not because she is so keen on him, but because he is the one man in dozens who seems to be preoccupied with things more important than her and is not badgering her with questions or doing a jig. She wonders what this man might be up to, and why he is so laissez faire with a woman of her physical caliber. He must know my secret! He must know I do not wash after the toilet! What a conquest it would be to capture his affections!... As she clicks the link to the event, she is spiked with the warm tingles, and fantastical thoughts of the man, painting him a hundred different ways in her mind. But the event isn’t for another two weeks—suddenly her excitement is polluted with a twist of anxiety and fear! Fucks sake, two weeks! Who is this man? What is he doing that is so goddamn important?! What if he changes his mind or cancels?! And with each passing fantasy and horror, her attraction, emotion and investment in this man she knows nothing about builds, for he is the man speaking the Language of her heart. Now what do you notice about the Feeling this man creates in the woman?”
			“I am seeing that the real emotion he creates in the woman is not from what he says to her, but what he does not say to her, sir!” Gregory shouted without hesitation.
			“Yes! Precisely! And that the Question is always far more seductive than the Answer. Our Pimp is using time as his canvas, and letting her imagination paint in vivid strokes. He has brought out the true simp in her, and fearing he may pass the invitation on to another woman, she responds thirteen minutes later 'I shall shine my dancing shoes.’ This is the way of the Pimp! He is in no rush. He is not antsy, or fearful of ‘losing’ some girl he doesn’t even know. He does not react to the world or the woman, they react to him. He sets the pace and the temperature. He struts smoothly and casually, but with great purpose and direction in each step he takes.”
			“Sir, I am beginning to understand this cool, calm patience a man must have with women… but does she not get bored and just move on to the next man if we are to wait days to respond to her?” replied a curious believer.
			“No, no, no… you must understand this is not some rigid system or tactic, and I am not telling you to always wait days or weeks when engaging with a woman. That too would have its own layer of predictability and dullness. I am emphasizing this idea of disappearance, or delay, only because I’m aware of the mindset the majority of you are coming from… a woman begins to engage with you and immediately you jump out of your goddamn seat to heed her call… I am trying to make you aware that a certain amount of coolness, distance, and patience in moments has Power. It is an art, and a very nuanced one. Like a great painter, think of time and space as the white of your canvas. The white of canvas gives dimension to the color. You must think about the context of your Dance with the woman, as there will be Magic moments when your disappearance or delay add great texture and flavor to The Ride you take her on. There may be times when you are actively going back and forth with her, in the moment, on the spot… there may be times she does not hear from you for days. Again, as one evolves from man to Pimp, this will come with no thought or conscious maneuvering, as your Mission and the more important engagements in your life will be dictating when you find the time or interest to engage with the woman. When you do find yourself communicating with a woman you are attracted to or have great interest in, I urge you to think to yourself ‘How would I address this woman if I only had minimal interest and attraction to her? How would I respond if she was the 300 pound woman with buffalo sauce smeared down her blouse?’ You would be light hearted, dispassionate and aloof. You would not go out of your way to humor her. You would not write long paragraphs and ask her a thousand questions. Your carelessness and detachment from any specific outcome with this woman would be the crux of your charm. There will come a time on the Path when all this will be a thoughtless process to you. Only for now, shall this Dance be a conscious endeavor on your part.”  
			“So I take it with this aloof nature of the Pimp, it is not in his nature to ever pursue a woman.. he simply moves on to the next one?” replied the man.
			“No—on the contrary, the Pimp is far more fluid than you assume. You are misinterpreting his aloofness for some kind of stubborn arrogance. He may very well pursue a woman if his desire or interest in a particular woman is strong, as he is well aware he has nothing to lose. He does not live in fear of having his ego bruised, or in fear of rejection… for he knows the Truth of Who and What he is, and what he brings to the party. Understand that the Pimp’s determination and persistence has a very different energy to the average man’s. Unlike the average man, the Pimp gives off no sense of need, only want. He is crafty, and creative in his pursuit, not dramatic, bullheaded or obnoxious.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, how does one balance this with other aspects of life?</p>

<p class="master">“Okay? You craft sandwiches… and you say that as if it is an empty pursuit… a realm that holds no potential for any kind of evolution or magic... but let me tell you the potential Mission of man comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. It is not in the “what man does” but in the “how he does it.” Do not think that Mission means a man must start a multi-million dollar company, or win an Oscar, or reach some fantastical level of social status. You may have a man that’s truest calling in life is simply to Teach... maybe his passion is for history and he teaches a middle school class. What matters is the hunger, relentlessness, and creativity he approaches his teaching with. How far he is willing to push to be the most legendary teacher that ever walked the Earth? Let me ask you… why do you spend your life making sandwiches?” 
			“Because it pays a fair wage sir, and I get joy in seeing people eat. I love sauces and the way they can bring a sandwich to life. I put sauces on everything.”</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">“And what matters is your Will, your Truth, and what you believe to be Right.. the world will try it’s best to push back, make you cave… but Man must conquer the Fear… he must never back down... at the end of the day there is only one real Question… will man choose Action or death. Are you a Pimp or a bitch, Raul?”</p>

<p class="student">Master, I struggle with this concept. Can you explain?</p>

<p class="master">After fifty minutes, the van finally came to a halt and the doors swung open. By the bustling and busyness of the street outside it was clear they were in the downtown of a city, but anyone’s guess as to where exactly. 
			The federal agents grabbed the three men and yanked them out of the van. As they were steered into an old, brick building and prodded up a flight of stairs, the agents railed at them.
			“Move! Hurry it up, you fucking degenerates! We don’t have all day.”
			At the top of the stairs, the agents shoed them into a small, square room with plain white walls. Cameras in each corner stared down at them, poised to broadcast their images on the local late-night news as the most wicked and dangerous of men.
			The Head Fed followed the Master, Raul, and Gregory inside and shut the door behind them. In the middle of the room stood a black table and three brown envelopes, each tagged with their names. 
			“Gentlemen, inside each of these envelopes we have the official documentation and proof of each of your crimes. Now Mr. Davis won’t be going anywhere... but because I am an extremely forgiving man, I am going to give you two scoundrels one last opportunity to rebuke your crimes and agree to testify against Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.... and if you are willing to comply, you may go on your way,” the Head Fed said addressing Raul and Gregory. 
			“You heard the man. Do not be fools… my fate is already sealed, the show is over… go on your way,” said the Master.</p>

<p class="student">Master, what separates those who master this from those who don't?</p>

<p class="master">When Raul got home, he sank into the couch and pulled the brown envelope from his pocket. He unfolded the envelope and placed it on the table in front of him. 
			As he replayed the Magic and adventure of the day, he became curious about so many things. How did the Master know my name? I never even spoke it… and I used a fake name when I signed up? Where was Master from? How many able Pimps were out there?…  He even wondered what the fake legal documents detailing his ‘crimes of Pimping’ might look like, and how clever the Master’s final Test was. He thought about framing the document and posting it in his bedroom as a constant reminder of The Path. 
			Raul tore the envelope and reached inside. He pulled out a folded sheet of paper and read aloud to himself:</p>
